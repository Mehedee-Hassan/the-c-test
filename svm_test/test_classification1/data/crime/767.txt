Man dies in Dhaka cop custody
A robbery case accused was found dead while on remand at the custody of Chawk Bazar Police Station in Dhaka this evening.

Jahangir Hossain, 24, was placed on a two-day remand this afternoon by a Dhaka court.

Mofiz Uddin Ahmed, deputy commissioner (Lalbagh Division) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, claimed Jahangir committed suicide hanging from the door-frame of a toilet in the custody.

He might have hanged himself with a blanket between 6:40pm and 6:55pm during a blackout in the area, the DC claimed, adding Jahangir was arrested several times before in several cases including drug peddling.

A two-member body headed by Additional Deputy Commissioner Sanjay Kumer Roy has been formed to investigate the incident, he said.

The body will be sent to Sir Salimullah Medical College morgue for autopsy, he added.
