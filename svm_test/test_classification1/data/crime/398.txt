Woman beaten by fraud manpower agent's gang dies
A middle-aged woman severely beaten up by a manpower agent and his henchmen succumbed to her injuries at Dhaka Medical College Hospital yesterday after fighting for her life for 19 days.

The deceased was Shahana Begum, 48, wife of Abdul Barek of Hizla Kanargaon in Keraniganj and mother of Mohammad Selim.

Manpower agent Iqbal of neighbouring village Bhawal Manoharia and his gang ruthlessly beat Shahana Begum at her house on November 27 as her son Selim tried to recover Tk 6.5 lakh from the agent after he [Iqbal] failed to send him to Italy.

Freedom fighter Rezaul Karim, brother of the deceased, said, "Around eight cadres led by Iqbal reached Selim's house in a microbus and started beating him. They later turned to his mother as she tried to resist their attempt to kidnap Selim."

The attackers escaped the scene when locals thronged there responding to the victims' scream.

Following the incident Shahana Begum was rushed to Mitford Hospital and then to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where she died yesterday at 6:00pm.

Rezaul said Selim gave Iqbal Tk 9.5 lakh in 2008 as he [Iqbal] convinced Selim that he [Iqbal] could make arrangements for sending him to Italy within 40 days of getting the contract money.

On failure, Iqbal returned Tk 3 lakh after repeated requests, he said. Later, a local arbitration on November 27 at Atibazar settled that Iqbal would refund the remaining amount of money to Selim's father. While the locals were mounting pressure on Iqbal's father in the arbitration, Iqbal and his gang went to Selim's house and attacked the mother and the son, added Rezaul.

A case was filed on that very day with Keraniganj Police Station in this connection but none was arrested yet, said police.
