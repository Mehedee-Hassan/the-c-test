2 fraud gang members held in Dhaka
Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) today claimed to have detained two members of a fraud gang from Dhaka’s Mohammadpur area.

The two detainees are Rabiul Hassan, 28, and Abu Bakar, 22, said Firoz Kawsar, operations officer of Rab-2.

“In a search operation at Rayerbazar, a team of Rab-2 detained the two from a house with around 160 passports,” the official told The Daily Star.

The elite force also recovered 87 fake seals of police, magistrates, government officials and various other officials, 2 laptops and other documents from their procession.

“Primarily we think the group was engaged in fraud by cheating people with various fake documents,” the Rab official added.
