Abducted BGB man becomes father
The wife of Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) Nayek Abdur Razzak, who was abducted by Myanmar border force on June 16, gave birth to a son today.

Razzak became father on the International Father’s Day, but his fate did not allow him to the face of his new-born child as he remains in the custody of Myanmar’s Border Guard Police (BGP).

His wife Asma Begum gave birth to their third child (whose name is yet to be finalised) around 11:00am at their Baliabari village home at Singra upazila in Natore.

Earlier, the BGP opened fire on a BGB patrol boat in Teknaf of Cox’s Bazar district in the early hours of Wednesday.

A BGB sepoy, Biplob Kumar, suffered bullet wounds during the firing and another BGB member, Abdur Razzak, was abducted by the BGP. Abdur Razzak is yet to be released by the BGP.

Talking to The Daily Star, Asma Begum said she is passing a hard time as she is not getting her husband beside her.

She called upon the government to take immediate steps to bring back her husband.
