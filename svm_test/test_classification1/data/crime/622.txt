Khaleda accuses ruling party men of widespread graft
BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia today alleged that the country is not going forward as the ruling party men are doing corruption in all sectors.

"Due to government's corruption, the country is not running as it should be….People want to get rid of this political culture of looting. A free, fair national election under a neutral administration is necessary to run the country properly," said Khaleda.

She made the remarks while addressing an Iftar programme organised by the Association of Engineers' of Bangladesh (AEB), a pro-BNP professional platform, in Bashundhara residential area in Dhaka, where she also claimed that people have been expecting a change very eagerly.

Former prime minister said as the government is not elected it has no responsibility to the countrymen.

She alleged though the people in diffident areas of the country are suffering from floods, the government does not stand beside them.

Referring to the recent media reports on wheat imported from Brazil, the BNP leader said the government is yet to take any initiative against the accused minister. “He is holding his minister portfolio without any barrier.”

Meanwhile, Khaleda Zia in a statement expressed her deep concern over the death of BNP leader Muslehuddin in the custody on Saturday night.

Terming the death of the BNP leader unnatural, she demanded fair and judicial investigation into the incident.

She alleged that Muslehuddin died in the jail like it’s another leader, Nasiruddin Pintu, as police did not arrange treatment when he felt sick.

Khaleda said the government arrested the BNP leaders and activists in good health and some of them died due to physical torture.
