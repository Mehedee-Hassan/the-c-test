Nazim murder: JnU students threaten strike Sunday
Jagannath University students today threatened to go on an all-out strike on the campus on Sunday demanding the arrest of their fellow Nazim’s killers.

“We will enforce strike on Sunday if the killers are not arrested by 12noon on Saturday,” Mehrab Azad, a spokesperson of the agitating students, told The Daily Star this evening.

Nazimuddin Samad, 26, a law student of Jagannath University, was stabbed and shot in Hrishikesh Das Lane in Old Dhaka last night. The injuries bore similarities to recent blogger killings.
