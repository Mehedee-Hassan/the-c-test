Postmaster held for embezzling deposited money in Satkhira
The postmaster of Kalaroa upazila main post office has been arrested on Thursday on charge of misappropriating Tk over 50 lakhs from depositors savings and permanent deposit scheme accounts.

Following arrest of the postmaster, Mir Abdul Haque, on Thursday night, police yesterday produced him before the court that sent him to jail, court sources said.

Deputy Postmaster General Samsul Arefin of Khulna Divisional Post Office who is probing the allegations against Abdul Haque, filed a general diary (GD) with Kalaroa Police Station after detecting misappropriation of funds by the accused, police said.

Abdul Haque has been misappropriating the deposited money of over 300 people who opened accounts with the post office, sources said, adding that he neither issued pass books to the depositors nor recorded deposited money with the ledger books of the post office for long.

Following the depositors' allegation to the postmaster general of Khulna Divisional Post Office against him, the former instructed Deputy Postmaster General Shamsul Arefin to probe the matter.

During primary investigation on Wednesday, Shamsul Arefin found Postmaster Abdul Haque guilty and handed him over to police the following day.
