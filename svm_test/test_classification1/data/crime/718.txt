The reports, then, didn't cite any sign of rape either.

Yaar Hossain, father of Tonu, noticed the back of Tonu's head was smashed and there were injuries in her nose. But the inquest saw no sign of injury or assault on any part of her body.

The first autopsy report says, “No sign of forceful intercourse before death was found. Victim was not pregnant. No definite opinion as to the death could be given.”

Protests and condemnation poured in the streets all over the country including Dhaka as people from different walks of life mourn Tonu.
