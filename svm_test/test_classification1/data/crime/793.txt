Tk 1.2cr looted from DBBL ATM booth in Gazipur
Suspected robbers looted Tk 1.20 crore from a fast-track ATM booth of Dutch-Bangla Bank Limited in Kaliakoir upazila of Gazipur early today, police say.

The cash was looted from the DBBL ATM booth beside Dhaka-Tangail highway in Harinhati area of the upazila, our Gazipur correspondent reports quoting Abdul Motaleb Mia, officer-in-charge of the local police station.

Seven employees of Money Plant, a financial institute, reached the spot in a microbus near the ATM booth around 2:30am. They had two trunks containing cash of Tk 1.20 crore. Two gunmen and security guards were among the seven employees, police said.

In the meantime, at least 12 miscreants on a pick-up van swooped on the DBBL’s ATM booth, beat up a security guard, Liakat Hossain, and took the two trunks away with them.

On information, police and Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) members visited the spot soon after the incident.

Meanwhile, police at Mymensingh found the two empty trunks and an ATM card at Bashdi of Phulbaria upazila, our local correspondent reports.

Cops from Phulbaria Police Station led by ASI Murshed recovered the trunks from a pond around 6:00am, said Phulbaria Police Station Officer-in-Charge (OC) Rifat Khan Rajib.

Kaliakoir police detained seven people for interrogation in this connection, OC Motaleb Mia said.

Money Plant’s chief operator Lt Col (Rtd) Abedin meanwhile lodged a robbery case with the police station, reports our Gazipur correspondent.
