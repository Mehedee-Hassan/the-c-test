MP Amanur gets bail in Faruk murder case
The High Court on Thursday granted bail to ruling Awami League MP Amanur Rahman Khan in connection with the killing of freedom fighter Faruk Ahmed.

The bench of Justice Md Miftah Uddin Choudhury and Justice ANM Bashir Ullah granted the bail after hearing Amanur’s bail petition this afternoon.

Police on February 3, 2016 pressed charges for murder of freedom fighter Faruk against 14 people including Amanur and his three brothers.

Faruk, also the then publicity secretary of Tangail district Awami League, was shot dead in front of his house in Tangail town on January 18, 2013.

Three days after the murder, Faruk’s wife Nahar Ahmed filed the case with Tangail model police station.

Amanur landed in jail on September 18, 2016 when he surrendered to a Tangail court in the murder case.

He had reportedly been in hiding to avoid arrest since August 2014 when he was named by two detained accused in the case.
