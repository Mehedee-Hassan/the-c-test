Govt moves to curb smuggling syndicates
Home Minister Sahara Khatun yesterday said the government is searching out the godfathers in the smuggling syndicates from a list to root out the crime.

"We have got a list of godfathers of smuggling gangs and we are trying to arrest the criminals as per the list," the home minister told reporters after a meeting of the Smuggling Prevention Committee at her ministry.

She also said detective agencies have been directed to make a list of smugglers, which would be sent to the law-enforcing forces to nab them.

Sahara said the government has not been able to arrest any of the godfathers though carriers of the contrabands have been caught.

"We will not only arrest the carriers of smuggling but also arrest the godfathers behind the smuggling to get rid of it like militancy and terrorism," Sahara added.

State Minister for Home Shamsul Huq Tuku, who was present at the briefing, said a list of the godfathers of smuggling syndicates was under preparation.

About the statistics of arrests, Sahara said the arrest of criminals has been reduced compared to the past four months while the seized contrabands increased 41 percent.

"The smugglers holed up in and outside the country after the reinvestigation of many cases like the Chittagong arms haul, August 21 grenade attack and SAMS Kibria murder cases," she told the journalists.

Asked whether any steps taken for arrest of the terrorists hiding in India, the minister said the government would take all-out steps to rein them in.

"We can take assistance of Interpol to arrest the terrorists, if necessary," she added.
