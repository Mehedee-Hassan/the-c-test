Lawyer jailed for forgery
The Chief Judicial Magistrate Court of Sirajganj yesterday sentenced a lawyer to five years imprisonment for forgery.

Advocate Golzar Hossain of Ullapara was found guilty for misappropriating Tk 1 lakh of Abdul Latif, owner of Laboni Steels Mills at Bazaar Station in Sirajgnaj town. Golzar took the money promising Latif to supply bricks from a brickfield on January 31, 1999. But he neither supplied the bricks nor refunded the money to Latif after passage of a long time.

Finding no other alternative, Latif lodged the case against the lawyer.

Chief Judicial Magistrate Arifur Rahman also fined the convict Tk 5,000, in default, to suffer six months more imprisonment.
