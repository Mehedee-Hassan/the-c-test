Two convicts in Rabbani murder case surrender
Chittagong court on Thursday sent two convicts in Commodore Ghulam Rabbani murder case to jail after they surrendered before it.

The convicts are Abu Naser Chowdhury, 72, former general manager of Korean Export Processing Zone, and Md Selim, 48.



Speedy Trial Tribunal Judge Md Muhithul Haque Enam Chowdhury passed the order after their surrender.



Meanwhile, the court rejected the bail petition of accused Md Saiful alias Bilai Saiful.



Commodore Ghulam Rabbani, the then managing director of KEPZ, former chairman of Chittagong Port, was shot by miscreants while he was going to visit a KEPZ site on April 11, 2004.



Thirteen days later, he died at a hospital in Bangkok on April 24, 2004.



Rabbani was a witness to the killing cases of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and four national leaders.



He was killed following a conflict between him and a few of his colleagues at the KEPZ over his appointment as its MD, and termination of its two employees before and after his appointment.



On April 7, 2005, a court sentenced Selim, Hashim and Abdul Malik Sohel to life term imprisonment in the case and Abu Naser Chowdhury and former chief security officer of KEPZ Humayun Kabir Chowdhury to five years imprisonment.



The court also acquitted Saiful and Mansur Alam.



Later, a petition was filed against the verdict with the High Court.



On February 12, 2014, the HC in its verdict sentenced Abu Naser to life-term imprisonment and ordered the lower court to review the acquittal order of Saiful.



On October 05, 2016, the HC released its full text of verdict and ordered Abu Naser, Humayun Kabir Chowdhury, Md Selim and Saiful to surrender before a lower court within eight weeks.



According to the order, Saiful surrendered to the court on December 05.



Besides, a file was submitted to the court mentioning the death of another convict, Humayun.
