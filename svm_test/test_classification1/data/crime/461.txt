Outrage over Philippine cybercrime law
A new cybercrime law in the Philippines that could see people jailed for 12 years for posting defamatory comments on Facebook or Twitter is generating outrage among netizens and rights groups.

The stated aim of the wide-ranging law is to tackle a multiplicity of online crimes, including pornography, hacking, identity theft and spamming, following police complaints that they lacked the legal tools to combat them.

However, the act also includes a provision that puts the country's criminal libel law into force in cyberspace -- but with far tougher penalties for Internet defamation than in traditional print media.
