2 RU teachers suspended for sexual harassment
Two Rajshahi University teachers were suspended last night on charges of sexually harassing some female students.

The suspended teachers are: Shaon Uddin, a lecturer at management department, and Sarowar Hossain, a trainer of Teachers’-Students Cultural Centre (TSCC), of the university, reports our RU correspondent.

The 450th syndicate meeting chaired by Vice Chancellor Prof Muhammad Mizanuddin suspended the duo as the university's Anti-sexual Harassment Cell found them guilty after investigation, said Prof Amzad Hossain, a syndicate member and also dean of the Business Faculty.

Some female students of management department filed a complaint with the cell against Shaon in September last year, bringing allegation that he used to harass them by making lewd comments in the classes, he said.

“After the investigation, the cell submitted a report to the syndicate with a recommendation to suspend Shaon," Prof Amzad, also the dean of Business Faculty, added.

Meanwhile, Sarowar Hossain was suspended for abusing a female student while giving her music lesson.

RU VC Prof Muhammad Mizanuddin told The Daily Star that the university syndicate suspended them based on the reports of anti-sexual harassment cell of the university.

Contacted, Shaon Uddin claimed that the RU authorities suspended him only to harass him politically as he has an involvement with ruling Awami League.
