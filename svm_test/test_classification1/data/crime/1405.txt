BCL men assault 2 HSTU teachers
Two teachers of Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University (HSTU) were assaulted allegedly by BCL activists on the campus in Dinajpur town yesterday as a candidate of the activists has been rejected for a university job.

The two teachers -- one of Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) department and another of Agro Forestry department -- alleged that around 25 BCL activists led by Arun Kanti Roy, general secretary of BCL HSTU unit, beat them up. Vice-Chancellor Prof Ruhul Amin also confirmed the incident.

Five teachers and 40 officials and employees have been appointed by the university authorities while Arun's girlfriend rejected for the post of section officer, university sources said.

Hearing the news, the BCL men assaulted the teachers to create panic among the other teachers and staff, added the sources.

However, Iftekhar Ahmed Real, president of BCL HSTU unit, and Arun denied the allegation of assault but they said they have only declared the two teachers unwanted on the campus.

The university unit of BCL yesterday submitted a memorandum to the VC, demanding cancellation of appointment of the two teachers whom they branded as Islami Chhatra Shibir activists. They also threatened to enforce an indefinite strike on the campus from today if their demand is not fulfilled.

A three-member probe committee was formed at an emergency meeting with the VC in the chair in the evening to investigate the matter.
