RU teacher forced into retirement on 'sexual harassment' charge
Rajshahi University authorities have sent Prof Dr Kamrul Hasan Majumdar, a teacher of the Department of Geology and Mining, into forced retirement on charge of "sexually harassing" a female student of the university.

The decision came from a Syndicate meeting on Thursday night, said Syndicate member Prof Dr Amzad Hossain.

Sources said the victim, a first year student of the university, lodged a written complaint to the university authorities on October 21, 2014 accusing Prof Kamrul Hasan of sexually harassing her.

Later, on April 27, 2015, an investigation committee formed by the authorities recommended suspending the teacher as he was found guilty in the incident.

RU Pro-vice-chancellor Professor Chowdhury Sarwar Zahan asked the probe committee to re-investigate the matter when the recommendation was placed at the 461st Syndicate meeting.

Later, a four-member review committee, headed by Sayen Uddin Ahmed, treasure of the university, was formed, which also found the teacher guilty, said Amzad Hossain.

Sources of the Committee against Sexual Harassment and Repression said the accused teacher had sent many objectionable proposals to the girl through mobile SMSs.

Besides, he also tried to allure the girl with good results and recommendation for a teacher’s post for her if she agreed to his proposal.
