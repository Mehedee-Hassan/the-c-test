Shazneen murder: SC rejects Shahidul’s review plea
The Supreme Court on Sunday rejected a petition filed by Shahidul Islam, the condemned convict in the Scholastica School student Shazneen Tasnim Rahman killing case, to review his death sentence.

A three-member bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha, rejected the petition of Shahidul Islam alias Shahid, who was a domestic help in Shazneen’s house.

Earlier on August 2, 2016, the SC upheld the death sentence of Shahidul and acquitted four other convicts in the murder case after hearing appeals against a High Court verdict.

Those acquitted are Syed Sazzad Mainuddin Hasan, a contractor for repair work of the house, Sazzad’s assistant Badal, and maids Estema Khatun Minu, and Parvin.

On April 23 1998, Shazneen, a class nine student of Scholastica School in the city and daughter of Transcom Group chairman Latifur Rahman, was murdered at her house.

On September 2, 2003, judge of the Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunal Kazi Rahmatullah handed down death penalty to six accused for their involvement in planning and executing the murder.

Lawyer of the plaintiff SM Shahjan said Shazneen’s father Latifur Rahman filed a murder case after the incident.

Later, Detective Branch of police filed another case under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act.

On July 10, 2006, the High Court upheld the death penalty of five convicts and acquitted carpenter Shaniram Mandal of the charges.

Later, four of the convicts filed a leave-to-appeal with the Supreme Court against the High Court order that was granted by the Appellate Division on April 26, 2009.

However, another convict, Shahidul, filed a review petition.
