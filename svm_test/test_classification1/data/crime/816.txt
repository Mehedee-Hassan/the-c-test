Two more accused in Chuadanga schoolboy murder killed in ‘gunfight’
Two more accused in the case of abduction and killing of Chuadanga schoolboy Mahfuz Alam Sajeeb, were killed in a reported gunfight with Rapid Action Battalion at Damurhuda in Chuadanga early Thursday.

The deceased were identified as Sabuj, 24, son of late Hamidul Islam, and Md Shakil, 23, son of Abdul Kader Mandal, residents of the upazila, RAB-6 crimes prevention company -2 commander Major Monir Ahmed told New Age.

RAB said a patrol team of the battalion set a checkpoint at Darshana Shantipara at about 3:00am, and signalled two motorcycles to stop.

The motorcyclists, instead of following the signal, opened fire targeting the checkpoint, while the battalion personnel retaliated by firing, he said.

At one stage of the gunfight, the miscreants managed to flee riding motorcycles.

The battalion personnel searched the area and found bullet-hit Sabuj and Shakil, both accused in Sajeeb murder case, the RAB official said.

The duo was immediately taken to the Damurhuda Upazila Health Complex where on-duty physicians declared them dead.

RAB also recovered two firearms, two machetes, and four rounds of bullets from the spot.

Earlier on September 17, the prime accused in the Sajeeb murder case Rakibul Hasan, also a union parishad member, was killed in a ‘gunfight’ with RAB.

A class VIII student of Chuadanga VJ High School, Sajeeb, was abducted on July 29 from Damurhuda upazila tree fair, and abductors demanded Tk 20 lakh to his family as ransom.

On August 31, Sajeeb’s body was recovered from the septic tank of a house owned by Rakibul in Chuadanga town.
