Writ challenges wheat imported from Brazil
A writ was filed with the High Court today challenging the legality of import and distribution of “substandard” wheat from Brazil worth Tk 400 crore.

Advocate Pavel Miah, a lawyer of the Dhaka Judges Court, moved the petition seeking order on the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) to launch an inquiry to find out whether any corruption was committed in the import.

The quality of the wheat was up to the mark when it was tested after being imported from Brazil four months ago, Bangla daily Prothom Alo reported today quoting Food Minister Qamrul Islam.

But the wheat is not inconsumable and rotten, he told Prothom Alo.

The petitioner also prayed to the HC to direct the government to test the wheat at Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI) and Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) whether it is fit for human consumption.

“The government has imported the substandard wheat from Brazil which is not fit for human consumption,” he said in the petition.

He requested the court to issue a rule upon the government to explain why the import and supply of such wheat should not be declared illegal.

Sanjid Siddique, a lawyer for the petitioner, told The Daily Star that the hearing of the petition may be held later today.
