Forgery case against former MP Ilyas Ali
A forgery case has been filed against absconding former lawmaker and Sylhet BNP chief M Ilyas Ali and four others.

Khajanchi Union Parishad (UP) member Angura Begum filed the case with Chief Judicial Magistrate's court here on Thusday.

The other accused are, UP chairman Rajab Ali, LGED upazila engineer -Habuibur Rahman and BNP leaders Abul Boshor and Faizur Rahman.

The then ruling alliance lawmaker Ilyas along with the help of others prepared a fake document (number 3841) on June 16, 2003 to grab lands of Unath Roy Sukla Baidya, listed as vested property. Unath Roy has left the then East Pakistan ands settled in India.

UP chairman Rajab Ali used the name of one Mokram Ali in the fake document, showing value of the land at Tk 10 lakh.

Later a UP office building was constructed on the land and compensation money was drawn though it was a government land. Angura alleged that her fake signature as a UP member was used in the resolution in this regard and she showing absent from office since February 27, 2006 just to harass her.

They also had been giving her threats since then, the UP member alleged.

Earlier, Angura filed another case against Ilyas Ali and four others for extortion. Police submitted charge sheet against the four days ago. Ilyas was shown absconding in that case while the UP chairman and others were released on bail after weeks in jail hajat.
