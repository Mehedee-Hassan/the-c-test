Earlier on Thursday, the VC reportedly assaulted Zakaria Swapan over publishing a report on nurses' recruitment in a Bangla daily.

“The VC pushed and pressed me against a wall at a meeting at his conference room where the proctor of the university also verbally abused me,” Pro-VC [Academic] Prof ASM Zakaria Swapan alleged on Thursday. The VC however denied the allegations.

The factions engaged in chase and counter-chase on the campus following the incident, the police official said.
