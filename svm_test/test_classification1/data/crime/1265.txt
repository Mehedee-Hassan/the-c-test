Bribery case against Tarique to go ahead
The High Court today cleared the way for trial court to run the trial proceedings against BNP leader Tarique Rahman and three others in a case filed on charge of bribery.

A HC bench of Justice Md Ruhul Quddus and Justice Mahmudul Hoque rejected four separate petitions challenging the proceedings of the case against Tarique.

The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed the case on October 4, 2007 against Tarique, BNP Senior Vice- Chairman, former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar and four others involving the murder of Humayun Kabir Sabbir, a director of Bashundhara Group, in July 2006. In the case, allegations were brought against the accused of taking and accepting bribes to suppress the murder case.

In 2008, Tarique, Babar and two other accused Abu Sufian, director of East West Property Development Pvt Ltd, a sister concern of Bashundhara, and former lawmaker Qazi Saleemul Huq Kamal, filed four petitions with the HC for scrapping the proceedings.

Today, the HC vacated its earlier order that stayed the proceedings against the accused petitioner.

It said the petitioner will remain on bail in the case but the lower court can cancel their bail if they misuse the bail during the trial proceedings.

After hearing on February 16, the HC bench fixed today for delivering verdict on the petitions filed by four accused, including BNP leader Tarique Rahman, for quashing the proceedings against them in the Tk 21 core bribery case.

Petitioners' lawyer Raghib Rauf Chowdhury said Tarique Rahman is now in London for treatment, Babar is in jail and Sufian and Saleemul are now on bail in the case.
