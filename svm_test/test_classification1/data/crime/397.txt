India's fraud-hit Satyam names new CEO
Fraud-hit Indian information technology giant Satyam announced Thursday a new chief executive for the fraud-hit company and said it had lined up funds to help tide it over a cash crunch.

The announcement followed a two-day meeting of the government-appointed board in the southern city of Hyderabad where Satyam Computer Services is based.

The board named senior Satyam executive A.S. Murty to the top job, ending a leadership hole created when Satyam founder and former boss Ramalinga Raju confessed to the billion-dollar fraud that shook corporate India.

"Murty is a Satyam veteran of 15 years... who brings to play a deep understanding of the organisation," the board said in an emailed statement.

"I have no misgivings about the enormity of the task in front of us, but together with my colleagues, I am confident we can accomplish the impossible," Murty said in the statement.

The board also said it had received "bank sanctions for a total sum of six billion rupees (130 million dollars) as a planned fund infusion towards working capital requirements.”

"This funding, along with healthy collections (from clients), is expected to help the company tide over its financial challenges," the board said.
