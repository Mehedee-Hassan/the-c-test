Tk 10 lakh needed for job in police: Ershad
Jatiya Party Chairman HM Ershad today expressed his concern over what he said is the widespread corruption in every sector across the country.

“They need to pay Tk 10 lakh to get a job in the police department while a school teacher needs to pay Tk 5 lakh for a job,” he said.

“In my tenure, we didn’t give jobs in exchange for bribes. We gave jobs considering the applicants’ quality and performances,” Ershad added.

Ershad, also a special envoy to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, made the remarks while addressing a biennial council of JP’s Munshiganj unit at the district Shilpakala Academy auditorium.

The JP chief said democracy has been exiled from the country as there is no freedom of expression at present.

“There is no democracy in the country at present. There is no freedom of writing or speaking one’s mind now. Democracy is now limited to mere speeches, it does not exist in reality,” he alleged.
