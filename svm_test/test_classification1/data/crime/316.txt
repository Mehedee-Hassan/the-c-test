UN official kidnapped in Pakistan located
The location of abducted UN official John Solecki has been found and 'he would be recovered very soon', Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has said.

John Solecki, the head of the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) in Pakistan's southwestern province of Balochistan, was kidnapped by gunmen from provincial capital Quetta Feb 2.

The foreign minister said that kidnappers of the senior UN official have been identified and government agencies have surrounded the area where Solecki is being kept, Dawn reported Friday.

The government was avoiding taking steps for his recovery in a haphazard manner which could pose harm to his life, the report said.

The Balochistan Liberation United Front (BLUF) last month claimed it was responsible for Solecki's abduction.

It threatened to kill the official unless over 1,100 people on a list of "prisoners" it provided were freed.
