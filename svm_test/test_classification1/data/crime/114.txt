‘Bomb-like object’ found in Sylhet city
Two days after the raid in Dakshin Surma, law-enforcers have cordoned off an area in Sylhet city in concern of a “bomb-like substance” found there.

The area in Shahi Eidgah was sealed off with yellow tape since 9:30am, our local correspondent reports quoting Mossharraf Hossain, officer-in-charge of Sylhet Airport Police Station.

“We are waiting for the bomb disposal unit to arrive at the spot,” OC Mosharraf said.

Anamul Haque, proprietor of Anam Enterprise, told The Daily Star that he found the “black object” at the door of his shop when he opened the shutters this morning.

Even as excitement continued in Sylhet, law enforcers, led by the special force SWAT, were raiding two suspected militant dens in the adjacent district of Moulvibazar.

Just two days ago, Bangladesh Army ended what was a long four-day raid in Dakshin Surma in the result of neutralising four militants and casualty of six others – including two police officials.
