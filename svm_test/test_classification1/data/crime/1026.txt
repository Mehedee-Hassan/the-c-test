Newly married woman killed for dowry
A newly married woman was killed by her husband over dowry at Char Koijuri village in Shahjadpur upazila on Thursday night.

The victim, Rozina Khatun, 18, got married only 20 days ago.

But her husband Jahangir Khan tortured her regularly for dowry money after their marriage, the police said.

Failing to realise the dowry money, Jahangir beat up his wife and strangled her at his house at about 10:30pm on Thursday.

Jahangir and all his family members went into hiding following the incident.

Receiving information, the police recovered the body yesterday morning and sent it to hospital morgue for autopsy.
