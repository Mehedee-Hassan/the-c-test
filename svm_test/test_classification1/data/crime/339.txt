Wife's appeal to get back kidnapped husband
Housewife Sinthia Kabir Mukta of Bashundhara residential area yesterday made a fervent appeal to all to get back her businessman husband who was kidnapped from in front of their residence one week ago.

At a press conference at the National Press Club in the city, Mukta said she filed a case with Badda Police Station, accusing seven people of abducting her husband Humayun Kabir on August 4 night.

She alleged that police neither could rescue her husband nor arrested any of the kidnappers.

Mukta suspected that the criminals might have kidnapped her husband following a feud over a piece of land in Paltan area.

The press conference was also attended by the victim's six-year-old daughter and brother Babul Ahmed Talukder.

In a written statement, Mukta said her husband sold five kathas of land out of nine kathas to some buyers. But the buyers claimed that they bought the entire land that resulted in a feud over the land.

She urged the government as well as the police administration to rescue her husband immediately and ensure punishment to those responsible for the kidnapping.

When contacted, Officer-in-Charge Kazi Wazed Ali of Badda Police Station denied the allegation brought by Mukta, saying that they were trying their best to rescue the victim and arresting the kidnappers.
