Two criminals arrested with forged notes, equipment
Detective Branch police arrested two criminals with forged notes worth Tk 45,200 and fake note-making equipment from a flat at Uttara in the city on Tuesday.

The arrestees were identified as Mohammad Jasim alias Tera Jasim, an accomplice of slain top criminal Rosen, and Jasim alias Chhoto Jasim.

Tera Jasim was also involved in the killing of Farid, the owner of Toma Hotel in Shaympur.

During a raid on the flat, the DB police seized 89 fake notes of Tk 500 and seven fake notes of Tk 100, a computer, a monitor, a printer and two dices.

During an interrogation, Chhota Jasim said he has been producing fake notes for two years and he has a network to supply the notes.

With the arrest of Tera Jasim, the number of criminals involved in the killing of Farid rose to seven, the police said.

Farid was shot dead in his hotel on August 13 last year.

AC Sanwar told The Daily Star that Tera Jasim went into hiding following the arrest of six other accused in Farid murder case.

A case was filed against Chhota Jasim and Terra Jasim, Uttra police said.
