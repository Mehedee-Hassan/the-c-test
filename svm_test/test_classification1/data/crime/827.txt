HC stays murder case proceeding against Ex-Savar councillor in Rana Plaza collapse
The High Court on Sunday stayed for six months the murder case proceeding against Savar municipality former councillor Mohammad Ali Khan in connection with Rana Plaza collapse.

A High Court bench of Justice Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury and Justice Ashish Ranjan Das also asked the government to explain why the proceeding against Mohammad Ali would not be quashed.

Mohammad Ali was one of the accused in the murder case filed for collapsing the nine-storey building, Rana Plaza, on April 24, 2013 that killed 1,136 people, mostly apparel workers and scores injured.

The former councillor, now in bail, was charged for giving no-objection certificate regarding approval of design of six-storey Rana Plaza construction primarily in 2008.
