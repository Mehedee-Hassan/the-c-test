Cops sued on bribery charge in Barisal
A bribery case was filed with Jhalakathi police station on Monday night against Habibur Rahaman, former officer in- charge (OC) of the police station and sub-inspector Fakrul Alam for allegedly forcing one person to bribe implicating him in a fake robbery case.

Md Nazrul Islam, deputy director of Barisal district anti-corruption commission (ACC) filed the case accusing the two for taking Tk 27,000 bribe from the victim's family.

According to the case, the two police officers arrested one Sheikh Hasan from a place at Kathpatty Road in the district town and beat him mercilessly on April 15, 2007. Hearing the news, Nasrin Khanom, wife of the victim, went to the spot and begged them to release her 'innocent' husband.

The two then demanded Tk 30, 000 for her husband's release. Nasrin gave Tk 27,000 to SI Fakrul on the day and promised to give the rest the following day.

But as she failed to pay the rest of the amount, the police officers sent her husband to jail implicating him in a 'false' robbery case, Nasrin alleged.

Deputy director Nazrul Islam of ACC told The Daily Star that Nasrin filed the complaint with ACC and the case is under investigation.
