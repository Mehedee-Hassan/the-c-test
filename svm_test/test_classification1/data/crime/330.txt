Remains of kidnapped boy found
Over three months after being kidnapped, the skeletal remains of an autistic 17-year-old boy was dug up around 150 yards off his Kamrangirchar residence in the capital on August 19.

The body's location came from the confessional statement of one of the kidnappers, Mohammad Samir, 32, a neighbour of the boy, on August 18 after Detective Branch of police arrested the kidnapper that day.

The boy, Mohammad Kawsar, was kidnapped on May 16. The kidnappers called up his father, Mohammad Ibrahim of Jaulahati in Kamrangirchar area, from a cellphone and demanded Tk 50,000 as ransom, said Kamrangirchar Police Station Officer-in-Charge AKM Nasirullah.

Ibrahim, owner of several tin-shed houses in the area, filed a general diary on May 17 and a case on May 24. Afterwards, police arrested seven locals tracking the phone call.

During preliminary investigation, Samir admitted that he and the seven killed Kawsar on May 18 over fears that Kawsar might reveal their identities.

Samir said they had kept Kawsar sedated for the two days right next door to the latter's house and later strangulated him.
