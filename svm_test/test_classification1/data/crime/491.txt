Man sent to jail for bail forgery
A Dhaka court yesterday sent a man to jail after cancelling his bail that he had obtained through a forged High Court order.

The court also served a show-cause notice on his lawyer, Abdus Salam, asking to explain within seven days why legal action would not be taken against him for submitting the fake HC order.

On February 28, Salam placed a bail petition along with an HC order, which he claimed had granted his client Saju Mia a three-week bail. Saju faces charges of torturing his wife for dowry.

After the hearing, Judge Arifur Rahman of the Special Tribunal for Prevention of Women and Children Repression accepted the bail petition.

In fact, the HC order Salam placed before the trial court involved one Md Mofazzal who faces an assault case filed with Niamatpur Police Station in Naogaon in October 2010. The HC granted Mofazzal a six-month bail on December 5 last year.

Salam changed the serial number of the original HC order and replaced Mofazzal's name with Saju's.

However, Saju's wife, the complainant of the case, came to know of the forgery and her counsel Jahangir Morshed brought the matter to the court's notice during yesterday's hearing.

After the hearing, the court cancelled Saju's bail and ordered to send him to jail.

Saju's lawyer, Abdus Salam, was present during the hearing.

Jahangir Morshed also appealed to the court to take action against Saju. The case against him was filed with Mohammadpur Police Station on August 11 last year.
