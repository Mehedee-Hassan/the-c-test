ACC to quiz Huda, Sigma in bribery case
A Dhaka court yesterday allowed the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) to interrogate detained former communications minister Nazmul Huda and his wife Sigma Huda at jail gate in connection with a case filed against them for taking Tk 6 lakh in bribe from a construction firm.

Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Golam Rabbani passed the order after ACC Assistant Director Belal Hossain, also the investigation officer (IO) of the case, submitted a petition seeking permission to interrogate the couple at jail gate.

Five witnesses--Syed Ahmed Faruk, RA Howlader, SM Abdul Mannan, Anwarul Haq and Mobarak Hossain--yesterday gave their statements before a magistrate against the couple. They all are high officials of Marganet One Ltd, a bridge maintenance firm.

But details of the statements, however, could not be known immediately.

On June 18, the ACC filed the case with Motijheel Police Station accusing the two of taking Tk 6 lakh in bribe from the owner of Marganet One Ltd.

In the case, the complainant stated that Nazmul Huda demanded bribe from the owner of the firm in exchange for a work order for the maintenance of Jamuna Bridge.

As per his demand, the owner of the firm deposited Tk 6 lakh to the account of Weekly Khoborer Antorale at Amin Court (Motijheel) branch of Agrani Bank in 20 cheques between September 30, 2004 and October 18, 2006, the case statement said.

Sigma Huda, who used to run the weekly, drew the money from the bank and the firm got the work order, the complainant said.

Earlier, separate special courts set up on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises acquitted Sigma Huda in two extortion cases and sentenced her to three years' imprisonment in a case on charges of abetting her husband in taking Tk 2.4 crore in bribe from the proprietor of a construction firm.

On the other hand, Huda was sentenced to different terms of imprisonment in bribery and extotion cases.
