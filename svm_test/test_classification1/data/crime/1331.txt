US bombing of hospital in Kunduz
Nothing can explain away the bombing of the hospital being run by the Doctors Without Borders in Kunduz on October 3. Reportedly, this is one of the most horrible and noticeable cases of civilian deaths inflicted by US forces in the 14-year war in Afghanistan – a war that was declared all but over by the US president. The air strike killed 22 persons including ten doctors and injured more than 30 people.

It is surprising that in spite of the fact that all the parties involved in the conflict in Afghanistan had foreknowledge about the location of the hospital it was targeted by the US air force. And so far, though we have had four different versions of the incident, it can be said with certainty that it was not an error caused by the heat of the battle, and the casualties cannot be dismissed as victims of collateral damage.

President Obama's apology will be of little comfort to the families of the dead and the injured. The current incident brings into greater relief the issue of civilian deaths in such circumstances which have so far been passed off as collateral damage not only in Afghanistan but also in countries and regions where conflicts are raging. In Afghanistan alone,14,000 civilians have been killed, good many of them by the US forces.

In this instance, there have been gross violations of rules of war. And it is only fitting that an international inquiry be conducted to ascertain the truth and hold to account those responsible for the bombing and the deaths.
