Money laundering: Destiny MD, another get bail
The High Court today granted bail to two Destiny Group top officials in two money laundering cases involving around Tk 4,200 crore clearing their way to walk out of jail.

The persons receiving the bail order are Destiny Group Managing Director Rafiqul Amin and Destiny Multipurpose Cooperative Society Ltd Chairman Mohammad Hossain.

The HC asked them to submit their passports to the trial court so that they cannot leave the country before completion of trial proceedings of the cases.

The bench of Justice Md Ruhul Quddus and Justice Bhishmadev Chakraborty came up with the verdict of bail after hearing two separate petitions filed by Rafiqul and Hossain in 2014 seeking bail in the cases filed by the Anti Corruption Commission.

The HC granted permanent bail to the accused Destiny officials on the ground that they have been suffering in jail for three years and eight months, ACC lawyer Khurshid Alam Khan told The Daily Star.

He also said the ACC will move appeals before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court against the HC verdict.

The commission filed the two cases in July 2012 against 22 Destiny officials on the charge of laundering Tk 4,200 crore.

It pressed charges against the Destiny Group MD, Destiny 2000 President Lt Gen (retd) Harun-Ar-Rashid and 49 others in the cases on May 4, 2014.

They were charged for misappropriating funds through Destiny's tree plantation project and from DMCSL, according to charge sheets.

The HC in October 2012 granted bail to Harun in the two cases on condition that he will no longer be involved with the group.

Barrister Ajmalul Hossain appeared for Rafiqul and Hossain.
