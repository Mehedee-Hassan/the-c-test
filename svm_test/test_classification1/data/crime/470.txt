Dhaka seeks int'l help to check cybercrime
Law Minister Anisul Huq yesterday emphasised strengthening the rule of law in cyberspace and sought international cooperation against cyber crimes in Bangladesh.

He came up with the call while addressing a three-day 2015 Octopus Conference on Cybercrime organised by the Council of Europe at Strasbourg, France.

Anisul spoke at the closing session as a designated speaker from Bangladesh on invitation from Gabriella Battani-Dragoni, the council's deputy secretary general, says a law ministry press release. Later, Anisul had a discussion on Bangladesh's cybercrime issues with Gabriella Battani-Dragoni and other dignitaries, who assured him of extending all sorts of support and cooperation.
