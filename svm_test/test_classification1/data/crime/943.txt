Six bank staff sued for embezzlement
A depositor has filed a case with Nilphamari Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court against six Rupali Bank officials in connection with misappropriating deposited money from Saidpur branch of the bank.

Assistant General Manager of the bank's Rangpur regional office, manager of Saidpur branch and four others have been made accused in the case filed by Meherunnesa, wife of rice trader Mozammel Haque of Khata Modhupur village of Saidpur upazila.

According to the prosecution, Forman Ali, an official of Saidpur branch of Rupali Bank, persuaded Mozammel Haque to open a Rupali Deposit Pension Scheme (RDPS) account in Saidpur branch of the bank to get a 'handsome profit'.

After opening a ten-year-term RDPS account (No 1151) in 2000 in the name of his wife Meherunnesa, Mozammel began to deposit Tk 10 thousand every month and thus he deposited Tk 10.80 lakh in 108 months (9 years) in that account, goes the case statement. In each month receipt was taken whenever the money was deposited, it added.

After incurring loss in business, Mozammel recently went to draw the money with due profit from the account but the bank officials concerned told him that there was no such account (No 1151) under the RDPS scheme in his wife's name.

The account holder, Meherunnesa recently lodged a case with the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court in Nilphamari accusing the six bank officials.

When contacted, Abu Taher Prodhan, manager of Rupali Bank Saidpur branch, said, “The matter might be an act of forgery by an organised group. The complainant opened an account No 15 under RDPS-2 scheme in 2007 to deposit Tk 500/ each month. According to bank records, only Tk 1500 was deposited in the account in three months. The complainant never opened any account under RDPS scheme with account No 1151 in 2000. They rubbed the writings of the passbook of RDPS-2 scheme to show it as a passbook of the account claimed.”
