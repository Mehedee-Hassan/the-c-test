2 JMB militants held in Narayanganj
Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) today claimed to have arrested two members of banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) in Siddhirganj upazila of Narayanganj.

The detainees are Abdur Rahman alias Sohel, 25, and Faysal Ahmed, 44, of Comilla, our local correspondent reports quoting handout of Rab-11.

They are active members of Sarwar-Tamim group, Rab claimed in its handout.

Tamim Ahmed Chowdhury was killed in a police raid in Narayanganj on August 27. He was a key “Neo JMB” leader and one of the masterminds of the Gulshan café and Sholakia attacks.

Sohel used to hold secret meetings with other JMB members and was maintaining communication with its new members. Besides, Faysal is a financer of the militant organisation.
