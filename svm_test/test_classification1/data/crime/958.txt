Tk 80 crore embezzled
Destiny Group Director Lt Col (retd) Didarul Alam yesterday confessed before a magistrate to embezzling Tk 80 crore from Diamond Builders Ltd, a sister concern of Destiny Builders Ltd.

Making the confession in a money-laundering case, Alam said he along with Destiny Group Chairman Rafiqul Amin and 20 other officials transferred Tk 80 crore of Diamond Builders to their personal accounts, court sources said.

The chief executive officer of Destiny Builders also spoke about the role of other top Destiny officials in the fraud, said sources in Dhaka metropolitan magistrate's court.

Though Diamond Builders was not making profit, the officials transferred the money to their personal accounts through fake documents and audits and later embezzled the amount. The money was collected from its investors on the promise of giving them huge benefits.

Metropolitan Magistrate Keshab Roy Chowdhury recorded the statement for over three hours and later sent the accused to Dhaka Central Jail.

On October 21, Alam was placed on an eight-day remand in the case filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC).

Mozahar Ali Sadar, a deputy director of the ACC, produced Alam before Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Bikash Kumar Saha, who assigned Keshab Roy Chowdhury to record Alam's statement.

Earlier on October 25, Rafiqul Amin and Mohammad Hossain, chairman of Destiny-2000 Ltd, confessed that they embezzled Tk 1,100 crore from a project of Destiny Tree Plantation Ltd.

On July 31, the ACC filed two cases with Kalabagan Police Station against 22 top Destiny officials for laundering Tk 3,285.26 crore.

Destiny Group started its journey in 2000 through its multi-level marketing wing Destiny 2000 with a capital of only Tk 12 lakh.
