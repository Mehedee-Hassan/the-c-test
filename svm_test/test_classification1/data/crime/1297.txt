2 education staff held for bribery
A team of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) arrested an upazila primary education officer and his office assistant while the two were taking bribe from a primary teacher at Muladi yesterday.

The arrestees are ABM Khaliur Rahman, Muladi upazila primary education officer, and Sirajul Islam, office assistant.

The education officer had earlier demanded Tk 3,000 in bribe from Anwar Hossain, headmaster of Boalia Primary School, to approve some bills against purchase of educational equipment for the school.

Yesterday, Anwar informed Major Shahriar Amin, director of Barisal divisional ACC, of the matter and went to the upazila education office to get the bills passed in exchange for bribe money.

On information, the ACC team laid a trap and caught red-handed the upazila education officer and his office assistant while they were taking money from the headmaster of Boalia Prymary School.
