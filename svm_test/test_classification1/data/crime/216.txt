Red alert at Benapole to prevent rawhide smuggling
Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) has issued a red alert in bordering areas to prevent the possible smuggling of rawhide to be generated during Tuesday's Eid-ul-Azha.

Lt Col Arifur Rahman, commanding officer of BGB-21 battalion, said they imposed the restriction on the movement of rawhide-carrying vehicles in the frontier areas, including Benapole and Putkhali, from this morning.

BGB members have already started their patrol along the border, he said.

The paramilitary force also urged people living along the border to remain alert in this regard.

The restriction will remain in force until further instruction.

Eid-ul-Azha, the second largest religious festival of the Muslims, will be celebrated across the country tomorrow.
