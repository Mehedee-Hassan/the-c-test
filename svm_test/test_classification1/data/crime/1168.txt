ICT probe body finalises report against four Satkhira war crimes suspects
The investigation agency of the International Crimes Tribunal finalised its report against four war crimes accused of Satkhira.

Mohammad Abdul Hannan Khan, coordinator and chief investigator of the agency, revealed this at a press briefing at its office in the city’s Dhanmondi area on Wednesday morning.

The accused are former MP and Jamaat leader Mohammad Abdul Khalek Mondal, M Abdullah Al Baki, Khan Roknuzzaman and Jahirul Islam alias Tekka Khan.

Abdul Hannan Khan said Mohammad Abdul Khalek Mondal is now behind the bars while three others remained absconding.

The 52-page probe report will be submitted to the tribunal’s prosecutor on Wednesday, Hannan Khan said.

Khan said the charges ranging from genocide to murder, confinement to torture and attack during the Liberation War were finalised.

Earlier on August 25, 2015, police arrested Mohammad Abdul Khalek Mondal from Satkhira in connection with a case filed for crimes against humanity during the Liberation War in 1971.
