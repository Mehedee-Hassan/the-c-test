Somali pirates seize Indian ship, 11 crews
Somali pirates have seized an Indian vessel carrying 11 crew members, the ship's owner said yesterday, the third such hijacking in less than a month as piracy resurges in the country. The "Al Kausar" cargo ship was carrying items such as wheat and sugar from Dubai via Yemen to Somalia's Bossaso port when it came under attack, owner Isaak Them told AFP.
