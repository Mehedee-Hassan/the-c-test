Somali pirates hijack UAE ship
Somali pirates hijacked a cargo vessel from the United Arab Emirates yesterday after firing small arms and rocket-propelled grenades at the ship, Europe's anti-piracy mission said.

The Orna was seized in the Indian Ocean around 400 nautical miles northeast of the Seychelles archipelago, the European Union naval force said.

"The attack was launched from two attack skiffs, with pirates firing small arms and rocket-propelled grenades at the merchant vessel," the EUNavfor mission said in a statement.

At least four pirates boarded the ship after stopping it, the statement said.
