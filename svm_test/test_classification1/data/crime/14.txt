Female thieves active in guise of domestic help
She uses different names to get jobs as a domestic help in the capital. But getting a job is not her main goal.

After managing a job she tries to make a good relationship with her employers and look for opportune moments when she can get keys of drawers and almirahs of the house and make duplicate ones with the help of her ex-husband Tarif.

Then she would wait for the right time to steal gold and other valuables with Tarif's help.

This 29-year-old woman, Sheuli Akter, stole about 700 tolas of gold and Tk 12 lakh from different houses in the city's Mirpur, Pallabi, Kafrul, Rupnagar and Shah Ali areas in the last seven to eight years, said Detective Branch (DB) of Police quoting Sheuli.

DB police, who recently arrested Sheuli, were addressing a press conference at Dhaka Metropolitan Police Media Centre yesterday.

Following her confessional statement, police also arrested three others of her gang and recovered 40 tolas of gold.

Mashiur Rahman, additional deputy commissioner of DB police, said although sheuli worked as a domestic help, she has a modern rented house in Gaibandha and there are three domestic helps to look after her children.

He said they arrested her from Gaibandha on August 17 and Tarif on September 11.

Last Thursday, police conducted a drive at Al Harun Jewellers in Shah Ali area and arrested its manager Shahin, 30, and employee Sujan, 28.
