UP chairman held for 'kidnapping' member
Police yesterday arrested Chairman of Charbaghdanga Union Parishad (UP) and two others from Puraton Bazar in the town on charge of kidnapping a UP member of the same union.

Police also rescued Altaf Hossain, from the house of an alleged kidnapper.

The arrestees are Joynal Abedin,42, acting chairman of Charbaghdanga union, Hazrat Ali,38, member of the same union and Aminul Islam Tipu,44, of Shibtola in the town.

Ahsanul Haque, Officer-in-Charge (OC) of Sadar police station said, all nine members of Charbaghdanga UP submitted applications on December 6 to the upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) bringing allegations of irregularities and corruption against the chairman in distributing vulnerable group feeding (VGF) rice allotted for November.

They also brought no-confidence motion against Joynal and the UNO office fixed date for hearing of the charges on December 13.

Sources said, the chairman somehow managed three members of the union including applicant Altaf Hossain and took undertaking from them that they would not back no-confidence move against him during hearing at UNO office.

But Altaf eventually fled to Godagari upazila of Rajshahi and took shelter at one of his relative's house.

The chairman went to Godagari and brought Altaf to Chapainawabganj town and confined him to a room at Shibtola so that he cannot join the hearing at the UNO office.

When Altaf's family members came to know it they informed police. Police raided Shibtola early yesterday and rescued Altaf from alleged kidnapper Aminul Islam's house.

Altaf Hossain later yesterday lodged a case against eight people including Joynal Abedin on charge of kidnapping him.
