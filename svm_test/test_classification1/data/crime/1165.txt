Rajshahi war crimes suspect sent to jail over extremism link
The Rajshahi senior judicial magistrate court on Monday sent a war crimes suspect to jail after police arrested him suspecting his link with extremism.

The judge, Bikash Kumar Basak, passed the order at noon when police produced Abdus Samad alias Feroj Khan alias Musa, 60, of Puthia upazila in Rajshahi, before the court.

Puthia police officer-in-charge Hafizur Rahman told New Age that a team of police raided Puthia Bazar and arrested Musa around 9:00pm on Sunday.

Musa, who allegedly blasted a bomb at village Tarash under the upazila, was arrested in an extremism-related case which was lodged with the police station two months back, the police officer-in-charge said.

Earlier on January 9-10, International Crimes Tribunal inspector Faruk Hossain visited Puthia and collected evidence of Musa’s crimes. He allegedly had committed crimes against humanity in Puthia during the war of independence.

According to the investigator, Musa had joined the collaborators in the beginning of the war.
