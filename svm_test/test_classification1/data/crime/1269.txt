Female colleague 'assaulted by Ansar commander'
The Ansar Commander of Magura district has allegedly kicked a female subordinate unconscious for "failing to collect bribe” for him.

The Ansar commander, Ahsan Ullah, denied the allegation.

The incident took place in Shalikha upazila of Magura around 9:00pm Saturday, a correspondent reports quoting the victim, Mumtaz Khatun. She is Shalikha upazila’s Ansar Commander

Khatun is undergoing treatment at Magura Sadar Hospital, Mamtaz Mazid, a medical officer at the hospital’s emergency unit, said today.

She is recovering well, he added.

According to Mumtaz, over 1,500 Ansar men were selected for duty during the upcoming union parishad elections in Shalikha upazila on May 7.

She alleged that district Ansar commander Ahsan Ullah demanded Tk 200 in bribe from each of the selected and asked her to get the money collected. “But I could not manage the money.”

Enraged at her failure, Ahsan Ullah kicked Mumtaz mercilessly with his boots until she fell unconscious.

“Later, the district commander boarded his car and left the place hurriedly,” said Abul Hossain, commander of Arpara Union Parishad.

When contacted for his version, Ahsan Ullah denied kicking Mumtaz.

He claimed it was Mumtaz who collected bribes from some Ansar members in the name of giving duty during the UP election next Saturday and is now making false allegations against him.

Abu Jihad Fakhrul Alam Khan, officer-in-charge of Shalikha Police Station, said he heard of “discord between the two”. “But police did not receive any complaint,” he added.
