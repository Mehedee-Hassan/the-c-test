Three Germans kidnapped in Yemen
Three Germans, among them a UN expert, were kidnapped in Yemen on Sunday, a security official said on Monday.

The three were seized in an area northeast of Sanaa and taken to a mountainous region east of the capital by their captors, the official said on condition of anonymity.

The identity of the kidnappers was not immediately known.

However, foreigners are frequently seized by Yemen's powerful tribes for use as bargaining chips in disputes with the central government. More than 200 foreigners have been abducted over the past 15 years.
