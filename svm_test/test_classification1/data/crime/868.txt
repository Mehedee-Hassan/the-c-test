HC receives seven-murder verdict copy
The High Court on Sunday received the Narayanganj seven murder case’s 165 page verdict and other documents from the Narayanganj District and Sessions Judge’s Court.

On January 16, former leader of ruling Awami League’s Narayanganj unit, Noor Hossain, 16 former Rapid Action Battalion members and nine others were sentenced to death for abduction and murder of seven people and dumping their bodies into Sitalakhya river in lieu of money in April 2014.

The seven murder case was numbered as death reference 3 of 2017, said the superintendent of Death Reference’s Section at the High Court Division.

Attorney general Mahbubey Alam later told reporters that the government would appeal to the chief justice for speedy disposal of the death reference considering it as a sensational case.

High Court Division’s additional registrar Sabbir Faiz said that hearing in the death reference for the confirmation of the death sentences would take a long time if the normal procedures are followed as about 500 death references were now pending with the High Court.

He, however, said that the Narayanganj death reference might be given priority over other death references if the chief justice allowed considering the public importance of the sensational case.

He said that if the chief justice gave priority to the Narayanganj death reference over the others, the High Court would need to prepare the paper book, a compilation of all documents including the verdict of the case, for the hearing in the death reference.
