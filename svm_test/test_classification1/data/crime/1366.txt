Eoin escapes a blackmail attempt
England one-day captain Eoin Morgan was recently the target of a blackmail attempt by an Australian man, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) revealed in a statement on Thursday.

The ECB said it had received an email from the man demanding a "five-figure sum" to prevent him revealing details of a relationship that Morgan had with a woman five years ago to the British and Australian press.

Following discussions with British police, the ECB approached the man, who "admitted and apologised for his actions, blaming jealousy". The ECB said the man is currently in a relationship with the woman in question.

"We will not allow anyone to disrupt our team's preparation or performance in the Tri Series and as we build up to the World Cup," said ECB managing director Paul Downton.
