35 charge sheeted in N’ganj 7-murder
Detectives today submitted the charge sheet of sensational Narayanganj seven-murder case against 35 naming Nur Hossain as the prime accused.

The 35 include 25 members of Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) including ex-top officials Tareque Sayeed Mohammad, Arif Hossain and SM Masud Rana.

Law enforcement agencies took almost one year to file the charge sheet of this case.

Mamunur Rashid Mandal, officer-in-charge of Narayanganj Detective Branch, submitted the charge sheet to Narayanganj Senior Judicial Magistrate Chandni Rupom around 5:30pm.

Hearing for framing charges will commence from May 11.

The 16-page charge sheet contains a description of 62 evidences and testimonials of 127 witnesses, reports our Narayanganj correspondent.

In April last year, seven people including Narayanganj city panel mayor Nazrul Islam and senior lawyer Chandan Sarker were abducted.

Their bodies were later found floating on the Shitalakkhya river. Gutted and the abdomen filled with stones, they were dumped in the river.

Nazrul's father-in-law Shahidul Islam alleged that Rab personnel abducted and killed Nazrul in exchange for Tk 6 crore from a local ward councillor Nur Hossain.

The three former Rab officials, which included the in-law of a minister, confessed their involvement to the killing.
