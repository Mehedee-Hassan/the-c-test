SC constitutes special team to probe Gujarat riot
The Supreme Court on Tuesday decided to constitute a special team headed by former Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) director RK Raghavan to probe 10 crucial cases of 2002 communal carnage in Gujarat.

A bench of Justices Arijit Pasayat, P Sathasivam and Aftab Alam took the decision while hearing a bunch of petitions seeking either a probe into these cases by the CBI or transfer of their trial outside the state.

The bench, however, decided to pass the formal order, constituting a "special investigation team (SIT)" for the probe on Wednesday.

The five-member SIT will also include A Sathpathy, a former police officer of Uttar Pradesh cadre.

The cases which are to be handed over to the SIT relate to rape, murder and arson at various places including those at Godhra town, Gulbarg Society and Naroda Patiya in Ahmedabad, Best Bakery in Vadodara, Baranpura, Machipith, Tarsali, Raghovpura and Pandarwada.

The bench was hearing petitions by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), rights groups and individuals affected by the communal carnage that broke out following the burning of 59 Hindu activists in a coach of the Sabarmati Express at Godhra on Feb 27, 2002.
