Transport workers assault doc triggering strike




All medical stores, private clinics and the government hospital in Gaibandha town remained closed for six hours from 6:00am yesterday protesting assault on a child specialist by transport workers on Saturday.

On the other hand, transport workers went on an indefinite strike in the district the same day demanding release of three transport workers arrested immediately after the Saturday's incident. They, however, withdrew the strike following a meeting at the deputy commissioner's office in the afternoon.

The trouble began on Saturday afternoon when Monu Mia, a transport worker, brought his ailing child to the private chamber of child specialist Dr Abdul Malek at Shoni Mandir Road in the town.

As Monu tried to enter the doctor's chamber, breaking serial, his (doctor's) attendant refused to let him go inside. Monu became furious and swooped on the attendant.

Hearing the news, a group of transport workers rushed to the spot, assaulted child specialist Dr Abdul Malek and ransacked his chamber.

Being informed, police went there and arrested three transport workers-

Ansar Ali, Kiron and Mithu Mia-on the spot while the rest managed to flee.

Immediately after the incident, Bangladesh Medical Association (BMA) Gaibandha unit protested assault on Dr Abdul Makek. At the call of BMA district unit, all medical stores, private clinics and the government hospital observed a half day strike in the town yesterday.

Following arrest of the three transport workers, District Motor-Truck Sramik union put up barricades on roads at different points and went on an indefinite strike in the district yesterday morning.

The deputy commissioner sat with the BMA and transport union leaders at his office yesterday afternoon to resolve the crisis. After a fruitful discussion, the transport union called off its strike.
