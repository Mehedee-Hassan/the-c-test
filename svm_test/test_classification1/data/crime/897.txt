A Rangpur court on Sunday fixed February 28 for delivering its verdict in the case filed for killing Japanese citizen Hoshi Kunio.

Judge of the Special Judge’s Court Naresh Chandra Sarkar passed the order after closing the law-point arguments of both sides.

Earlier, on November 15, 2016, a court framed charges against seven members of banned Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh in Hoshi Kunio murder case.

Of them, Masud Rana, Ishak Ali, Liton Miah, Abu Sayeed and Sakhwat Hossain are now in jail while Saddam Hossain and Ahsanullah Ansari have been on the run and Nazrul Islam was killed in a gunfight in Rajshahi.

Hoshi Kunio, 65, was gunned down by unknown assailants near his farmhouse at Kachu Alutary in Kaunia upazila on October 3, 2015.
