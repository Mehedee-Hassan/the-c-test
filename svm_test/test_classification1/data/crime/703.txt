Culture of impunity led to more killings: Fakhrul
BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir today said that increased incidents of killings have arisen out of a prevailing culture of impunity in Bangladesh.

Criminals are killing university teachers frequently as mysteries behind the incidents are not being unveiled and killers are not being tried, Fakhrul said in a statement.

Instead of solving these problems, the government is using the state machineries only to ensure its patty political interest and to daunt its political opponent, he said.

Due to this, criminal activities like killings, abduction, secrete killing, forced disappearance and extra judicial killing are increasing in the country, he alleged.

In the statement, Fakhrul condemned at the death of RU teacher Prof AFM Rezaul Karim Siddiquee and expressed his deep shock at the family members of the deceased.

He condemned the killing of Rajshahi University teacher Prof Rezaul Karim Siddiquee and called out to the government for immediate arrest and punishment of the killers.
