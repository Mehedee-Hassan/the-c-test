China busts 6,200 commercial bribery cases
China busted more than 6,200 cases of commercial bribery involving hundreds of millions of dollars last year, state media reported on Monday.

Authorities cracked down on 6,227 business-related bribery cases totalling 1.65 billion yuan (241 million dollars) in 2008, the Xinhua news agency said, citing the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.

Some 726 cases related to medicine sales while 216 were linked to construction projects, the report said.

Regulators this year will keep a close eye for potential corruption emerging from the roll-out of China's four-trillion-yuan economic stimulus package and rebuilding projects of areas hit by last year's earthquake, Xinhua said.

The 8.0-magnitude earthquake hit China's southwest on May 12 last year, leaving up to 88,000 people dead or missing, and billions of dollars have been spent on reconstruction work.

Xinhua said that authorities also vowed to watch for graft in fields such as land transactions and resources exploitation -- two areas that often trigger disputes or even social unrest in China.
