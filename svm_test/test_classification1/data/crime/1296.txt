3 ACC staff removed for bribery
The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has decided to send its three staff into forced retirement and demote another on charge of bribery.

The commission has also cautioned seven other staff, said ACC Director General (Admin) Col Hanif Iqbal at a routine press briefing at the ACC headquarters yesterday.

Habibullah, a data entry/control operator and constables Mizanur Rahman and Golam Rasul will be sent to forced retirement while Abdur Rahman, another data entry/control operator in Narsingdi, will be demoted.

The commission made the decision after departmental enquiry found the ACC employees' involvement in bribery.

ACC sources said Habibullah blackmailed many people in Narail into giving him bribes abusing his position as ACC employee.

He realised Tk 500 as bribe from a person in Narail before the Bureau of Anti-corruption became defunct.

The matter came to light after the person lodged a complaint with the commission.

In fear of losing job, Habibullah tried to reach an understanding with the person but failed.

ACC in an investigation found Habibullah guilty of realising bribes.

Police caught ACC employee Abdur Rahman red handed while he was taking bribe at a government office in Narsingdi.
