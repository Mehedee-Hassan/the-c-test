Massive question paper fraud
RAB's arrest of twenty people linked to the sale of fake question papers for medical and dental admission tests is a commendable act which allowed for this racket to be stopped. The widespread nexus of this entire racket is astonishing. Involved are bankers, a university professor, a doctor and several students, to name a few. The fact that this academic scandal was so widespread and involved people of so many different professional backgrounds is a tremendous eye opener, along with the fact that some of these people are in highly placed positions.

Needless, to say, the question papers being sold did not match the original ones, further proving the extremely malicious intent of those being allegedly accused.

The members of the racket had taken cash in advance from the students and their families, money which was seized by RAB to be returned to the students and their families. Along with the money, 29 cell phones and 3 motorcycles were also seized, further demonstrating the extensive network of this racket.

One of the arrestees claimed that he lost Taka 10 lakhs in the stock market and therefore concocted this plan to recover his losses, cheating students who are aspiring doctors.

It is our view that when the judicial process terminates, due punishment should be given to the proven perpetrators of this crime. Professional exams are highly sacrosanct and as a result, the confidentiality of question papers will have to be protected. Surely, the vulnerability of our system has been blatantly exposed.
