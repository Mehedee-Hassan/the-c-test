Burglary at MP's house
A burglary took place at the flat of a woman lawmaker in the city's Tikatuli under Sutrapur Police Station early yesterday.

Rowshan Jahan Sathi, a ruling party lawmaker from the reserved seat, and her family members were not at the flat during the incident, police said.

Quoting family members, Nazrul Islam, officer-in-charge of the police station, said two tolas of gold ornaments and Tk 3,000 were stolen from the house.

Sub-inspector Mahfuzur Rahman said the theft happened on the first floor of a three-story building on Abhoy Das Lane around 2:30am.

“It is not clear how the thieves entered the house,” he said.

“When the residents of the building reacted after sensing something sinister on the first floor, the thieves fled breaking a door of the kitchen,” SI Mahfuzur added.

The thieves ransacked the rooms, and coins were found scattered on the ground, police said.

Earlier on January 9, armed robbers made away with around 86 tolas of gold ornaments and over Tk 6 lakh from a flat of ruling party lawmaker Shahida Tarekh Dipti at the city's Pallabi.
