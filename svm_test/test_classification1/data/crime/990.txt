Sexual harassment: Ahsanullah teacher on 2-day remand
Mahfuzur Rashid Ferdous, a teacher of Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology in Dhaka, was placed on a two-day remand today in a case filed over sexual harassment.

Metropolitan Magistrate of Dhaka Md Delwar Hossain passed the order after Kalabagan police produced him before his court around 3:00pm with a seven-day remand prayer, reports our court correspondent.

Ferdous was arrested last night from Eskaton area of the capital, Mohammad Iqbal, officer-in-charge of the police station, told The Daily Star this morning.

He was arrested after days of protests at the campus over the issue.

Protesting the “harassment”, students of Ahsanullah University have been demonstrating at the campus.

Compelled by the protests, university authorities suspended Ferdous, a teacher of electrical engineering department, last Saturday. A case was filed last night in this regard.

Students allege the teacher has a long record of sexually harassing female students.
