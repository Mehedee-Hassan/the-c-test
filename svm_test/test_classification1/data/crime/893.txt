The three-judge International Crimes Tribunal-1 on Sunday said it would deliver the verdict in the war crimes case against absconding Shariatpur war crimes accused Edris Ali Sarder alias Gazi Edris.

The tribunal led by Justice Anwarul Haque on November 2 had kept the case pending for judgement.

This would be the 27th verdict in as many war crimes cases in independent Bangladesh. It would be ICT-1’s 16th verdict.

In 1971, Edris, 67, from Mahmudpur, Shariatpur was a leader of Islami Chhatra Sangha, as the student wing of Jamaat was then called.

He joined the Razakar force and committed crimes against humanity, according to the prosecution.

He was tried in absentia on four counts of crimes against humanity.

He committed the crimes at different places under the then Palang police station of the then Madaripur sub-division and Madaripur town.

He was tried on charges of committing genocide, raping, abduction, torture in confinement, carrying out arson attacks and looting.

On May 2, Edris of Paschim Kashabhog and Sulaiman Mollah, 84, of Kashipur Muslimpara of Shariatpur were indicted.

Sulaiman, a Muslim League leader in 1971 who joined Peace Committee and the Razakar Bahini, died in jail on October 25.

At the trial stage, 13 prosecution witnesses gave evidence against the accused. The defence produced no witness.
