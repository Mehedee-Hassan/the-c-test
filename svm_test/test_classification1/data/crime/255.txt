2 Afghan aid workers kidnapped
Unidentified gunmen kidnapped two Afghan aid workers contracted to a development ministry, the government said yesterday as the Taliban vowed more abductions following the just-ended South Korean saga.

The aid workers from a local non-governmental organisation contracted by the Ministry of Rural Development and Rehabilitation were snatched on Monday in the western province of Nimroz, the ministry said in a statement.

The two men were picked up while consulting with local community leaders about public welfare projects, the ministry said.

The latest abductions come as a Taliban spokesman said the extremist militia would continue abducting foreign nationals after the recent kidnapping of 23 South Koreans proved an effective tool in its fight against the government.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the latest abductions.
