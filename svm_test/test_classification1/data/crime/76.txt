Vandalism at NSU
Vandalism has become the commonest thing in Bangladesh. When the private university ordinance was passed in 1992, it was thought that private universities would remain free from campus violence. But that good-thinking has not come true. The recent vandalism at NSU and some other private universities caused much consternation to people. Eighty per cent people of Bangladesh can't afford the costs of those universities.

But violence is not the answer to any dispute.
