Woman murdered for dowry
A woman was allegedly stabbed to death by her husband for dowry at Dhanua Kamalpur village under Bakshiganj upazila on Sunday night.

The deceased, Khuku Moni, 28, was wife of Noor-e- Alam at the village.

According to victim's sister Lovely Begum, Alam was a drug addict and he used to torture Khuku off and on for dowry. Although her parents gave Alam Tk 5 lakh as dowry by selling 4 bighas of land about a year ago, he put pressure on her for more money.

Being disgusted, Khuku along with three daughters, came to her parents' house at Uttar Bhatkhawa village under Dewanganj upazila about a week ago, Lovely said.

On Saturday, Alam somehow managed his wife and took back her to his house.

On the fateful night, the couple locked in an altercation over dowry. At one stage, Alam stabbed Khuku with a sharp knife, neighbours said, adding that they took Khuku to the upazila health complex where doctors declared her dead.

Neighbours caught Alam and handed him over to police.

Contacted, Bakshiganj police station officer in-charge (OC) Fazlul Karim said they recovered the body and sent it to Jamalpur General Hospital morgue for autopsy.

Victim's elder brother Mozammel Haque filed a murder case with Bakshiganj Police Station accusing Noor-e-Alam.
