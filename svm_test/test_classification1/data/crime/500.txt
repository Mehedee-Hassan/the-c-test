Rab captures cheque forgery gang
Rab arrested three members of an inter-district gang who have long swindled depositors out of millions of taka through forged cheques.

The arrests were made on Monday and Tuesday in Barisal, Madaripur and Dhaka. The law enforcers also recovered Tk 3 lakh and chequebooks and deposit slips of different banks.

The cheats were identified as ringleader Maznu Khan, 42, Saiful Islam alias Sumon Matubbar, 35, and Bachchu Matubbar, 34. They hail from Ghunsi and Kukrail villages in Madaripur's sadar upazila.

Disclosing the arrests at a press briefing in Barisal yesterday, Rab officials said they first nabbed Bachchu as he tried to draw out Tk 3 lakh from an Uttara Bank branch in Barisal through a forged cheque.

On Bachchu's confession that his accomplices have already drawn Tk 3 lakh from the same bank branch and managed to slip out of the town, Rab raided Sumon's village home in Madaripur early Tuesday, arresting him with the money.

The ringleader Maznu was arrested Tuesday evening at a Sayedabad restaurant in Dhaka.

The arrested admitted that their gang have drawn more than ten crore taka through forged cheques in last eight years. Rab said their operation to arrest the other cheaters would continue.
