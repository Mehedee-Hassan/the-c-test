BCL men assault principal




Activists of Chhatra League assaulted a newly-appointed principal at Barisal Government Brojo Mohan College (BM College) yesterday.

Prof Shankar Chandra Dutt was driven out of the campus by a rowdy band of BCL, BM College unit, led by its joint convenor Moin Tushar in the afternoon when he went there to take charge, witnesses and local people said.

Moin Tushar, however, rejected the accusation and claimed that his men had rescued Shankar instead and arranged for his safe exit from the campus.

Maksudul Alam Masud, joint convener of another faction of the BCL unit, alleged that the outgoing principal Prof Nani Gopal Das and a section of BCL men loyal to him had a role in the incident. They had been involved in corruption and admission trade and so want cancellation of the new appointment to keep their misdeeds from getting exposed.

Nani Gopal refuted this claim and said he had already handed over the charge to the acting principal on February 3.

The attackers also blocked the approaching road to the college by burning tires. When they chased Prof Shankar, he took shelter inside a petrol pump and left the area later.

Shankar told The Daily Star that he was assaulted by some unruly students of the college and informed the higher authorities about the matter.

Askok Nandi, assistant commissioner of Barisal Metropolitan Police, said hearing the news he visited the area and deployed police force and patrol there.

Prof Nazrul Islam, acting principal of the college, said he felt helpless amid such a situation. BCL men have kept all college activities suspended and have not been letting general students enter the campus since January 29.
