A Dhaka court will deliver its verdict in a case filed against Oishee Rahman for killing her parents – Mahfuzur Rahman, an inspector of police’s special branch, and Swapna Rahman – in 2013.

Speedy Trial Tribunal-3 Judge Md Sayeed Ahmed passed the order in presence of Oishee and her two friends Asaduzzaman Johnny and Mizanur Rahman Roni.

The bodies of Mahfuzur and his wife were recovered at their Chamelibagh residence in Dhaka on August 16, 2013.
