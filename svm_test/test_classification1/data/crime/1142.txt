A gang backed by a section of influential people have continued to loot trees from Gangamoti reserve forest near Kuakata.

The gang cut down five trees on Friday night and Saturday. They also took away 7 more trees 15 days ago from the same area.

Locals said five rain trees, each over 20 years old, were felled by a gang on Friday night and Saturday morning.

On hearing the news that a gang cutting down trees on the flood control dam at Char Kawa under Gangamoti reserve forest, a team of local newsmen visited the spot on Saturday morning. They found two woodcutters, Faruque Akon and Khokon Howlader of same village, were engaged to fell the trees. The team identified at least five trunks of trees that were cut down by the gang.

Both the woodcutters told journalists that they were hired by some Humayun Jomaddar and Hemayet Hossain Pannu of the area.

Earlier, the same gang looted at least seven more big trees from the spot, local people alleged.

A staff at Gongamoti forest office said they recently seized 30 cft trees from a gang. But he refused to identify the culprits for reason unknown.

This correspondent tried to talk with Humayun Jomaddar but his cell phone was found off. However, Hemayet Hossain Pannu was available who said that some trees damaged during Cyclone Mohasen have been kept under their custody by forest men.

Contacted, Mihir Kumer Do, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) in Patuakhali said he would take lawful action after investigating the matter.
