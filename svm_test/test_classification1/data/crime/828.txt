The Appellate Division of Supreme Court on Tuesday acquitted the four accused in connection with their involvement in raping and killing City College student Rushdania Bushra in 2000.

The Appellate Division cancelled the High Court verdict that upheld death sentence of MA Kader and life terms of his wife Runu Kader and also upheld another High Court order acquitting Sheikh Shawkat Ahmed and Sheikh Kabir Ahmed in this connection.

An Appellate Division bench headed by chief justice SK Sinha pronounced the verdict after hearing appeals filed by Kader and his wife against their conviction awarded by the High Court in 2007.

The bench also rejected the government’s appeal against acquittal of Shawkat and Kabir of the murder charges.

In 2003, a trial court sentenced MA Kader and Kabir to death and jailed Runu Kader and Sawkat for life over the rape and murder.

On July in 2000, a second year student of City College Bushra was raped and killed at her maternal uncle’s flat, who was living in America at West Malibagh in the capital.

The four accused were also used to live with Bushra in the same house as they were her relatives.
