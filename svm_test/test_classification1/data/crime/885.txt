Sagar-Runi murder mystery to be debunked soon: Minister
The minister for home affairs, Asaduzzaman Khan, on Thursday said Rapid Action Battalion members will soon unearth the mystery behind the murder of journalist couple Sagar-Runi.

‘I don't know about the progress of investigation into the Sagar-Runi murder case but hope RAB will dig out the mystery behind the murders after investigation,’ he said while talking to reporters after attending a welfare meeting of Armed Police Battalion, held in the city's Uttara area.

As per the directives of the High Court, the RAB is investigating the Sagar-Runi murder case and they have submitted the progress report on the case before the court, he said.

Maasranga Television News Editor Sagar Sarowar and his wife ATN Bangla senior reporter Meherun Runi were found dead at their rented apartment in the city's West Razabazar area on February 11, 2012.

On April 18, 2012, the High Court asked the inspector general of police to hand over the case to RAB for investigation.
