2 Brac officials abducted in Afghanistan
Two Bangladeshi Brac officials working in Afghanistan were abducted by unidentified miscreants from Kunduz city yesterday.

The victims are: Haji Swakat, 50, chief engineer, and Md Sirajul Islam Sumon, 37, chief accountant of Brac. Both hailed from Pabna district.

Some gunman kidnapped three Brac officials, including an Afghan national, while they were going to Baghlan from Kunduz around 4:00pm local time, Mahbubul Alam Kabir, senior media manager of Brac, told UNB.

He said the miscreants later released the Afghan citizen.

No militant group is yet to claim responsibility of the abduction.

Brac has been working in Afghanistan since 2002. Setting up around 400 offices in the country’s 34 provinces, the NGO is providing education, healthcare, training, and development tools to the citizens of the war-hit country.
