Father files murder case against Indian fellow student
Maldivian model and medical student Raudha Athif’s father Mohammad Athif on Monday filed a case with Rajshahi Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court against one of her fellows.

The accused, Sirat Parvin Mahmud, second year MBBS student of Rajshahi Islami Bank Medical College, is from Kashmir in India.

‘Raudha was killed by strangulation,’ the plaintiff claimed in the case.

Lawyer Kamrul Monir told New Age that the judge of the court Saiful Islam took the case in cognizance and asked the Shahmakhdum police to record and investigate it.

Earlier, on Thursday, Athif had told reporters that he would file a case over the death of his daughter since he is not satisfied with her autopsy report.

Mohammad after filing the case said, ‘I asked the autopsy team some important questions, but they failed to give me any satisfactory answer. As I said earlier, there is something mysterious behind the death.’

He said Raudha had phoned them the night before March 29 and she sounded perfectly normal, but was found dead the next morning.

He asked how the medical college authorities had brought down her hanging body without breaking open the door of her room and that too before police reached the scene.

Mohammad, also a doctor, claimed there were no marks of injury on her neck, which he thinks should have been there if she had hanged herself from the ceiling fan.

‘Instead, there were some finger impressions on her neck,’ he said.

Meanwhile, two Maldivian police officials arrived in Rajshahi on Monday and separately talked to the medical college authorities over the death.

Raudha was buried on Saturday in Rajshahi after the autopsy report said her death was a suicide.

The 21-year-old’s body was found hanging from the ceiling fan in her dorm room on March 29.

She had been living at the college dorm since January 14, 2016. She was on the cover of Vogue India magazine in October 2016.
