'Fraud' couple arrested in Mymensingh
A 'fraud' couple was handed over to Iswarganj police yesterday after their arrest by Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) from Tarakandi village on Sunday.

Md Abdur Razzaq Fakir, 50, a quack, and his wife Firoza Begum, 40, allegedly took Tk 8 lakh 50,000 from Rokeya Begum of Sharifpur village in Gazipur on a false promise to give her back Tk 7 crore. They said they are in possession of 'unnatural' power which will be used to discover 'hidden treasure' from the victim's house. The frauds made her believe that all the inmates of her house would die if the hidden wealth remained undiscovered.
