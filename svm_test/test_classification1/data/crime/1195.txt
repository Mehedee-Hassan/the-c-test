The attack came a week after a Shia homeopathic doctor was killed in Jhenaidah and a Hindu priest killed in Panchagarh – both of which were works of IS as claimed by SITE.

SITE Intel Group is the only link between the murders and Islamic State so far.

Bangladesh authorities, however, have repeatedly denounced the existence of Islamic State in the country.
