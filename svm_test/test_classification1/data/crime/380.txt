Koko furnished forged papers with petition
BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's son Arafat Rahman Koko tendered “forged and manufactured” documents to the HC with his writ petition challenging the proceedings of a money laundering case against him, alleged the government in an application to the High Court yesterday.

Koko, now staying in Thailand for treatment on parole, authorised Taherul Islam Tawhid to file the writ petition. But the authorisation letter was authenticated by an unauthorised person in Dhaka, not by any official at the Bangladesh embassy in Thailand, it said.

Lawmaker barrister AM Mahbub Uddin Khokon, who attested Koko's signature as his lawyer, has no authority to do so as “Khokon was not present before Koko in the relevant time,” reads the application.

Khokon obtained the signature of the assistant secretary (consular) at the foreign affairs ministry in Dhaka on the letter, putting “undue pressure” on the official, it said.

The government prayed to the HC for conducting an inquiry into the matter and directing the authorities concerned to file a complaint against the persons responsible.

During the hearing of the application, Attorney General Mahbubey Alam told the court that Khokon went to Bangkok to meet his client Koko in January this year, but he signed the authorisation letter on August 2.

He said Khokon forced the official in Dhaka to put signature on the letter using his influence as a lawmaker.

Koko's counsel advocate TH Khan told the court that the writ petition was filed on behalf of his client with the court's permission and the court can issue a rule asking the state why the case proceedings should not be quashed.

The HC bench of justices Syed Refaat Ahmed and Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury fixed Monday for delivering orders on the application and the writ petition.
