3 staff sued for embezzling Tk 2.40 lakh
The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) yesterday sued two officials and an employee of Rajshahi Higher Secondary Teachers Training Institute (HSTTI) for allegedly embezzling Tk 2.40 lakh by enrolling fake people in a government training programme.

The accused are Rajshahi HSTTI Director Swapan Kumar Dutta, Additional Director Selina Afroze and steno typist Jahangir Hossain.

The accused organised the training for headmasters of different Rajshahi schools between May 20 to 26, 2010 and financed it with funds allocated for the development of HSTTI hostels, said Rajshahi ACC Deputy Director Manjur Morshed.

The two top officials also ignored their responsibilities, giving Jahangir the opportunity to enrol fake headmasters, said Manjur, who filed the case with Rajpara Police Station.

The police station Officer-in-Charge Mokarram Hossain said the case was referred to ACC for investigation.
