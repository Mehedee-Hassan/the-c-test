Commemorating Tanwir Muhammad Taqi on the fourth anniversary of his murder, campaigners said on Saturday that the delay in the trial of Taqi murder case was a shame for the government.

At the launching ceremony of a book, Taqi Ongkare Gandharbe, at Liberation War Museum in Dhaka, they alleged that the government was hindering the trial to save an influential family in Narayanganj.

Dhaka University professor emeritus Serajul Islam Chowdhury said that the murder of Taqi made people guilty as the people concerned had failed to make the country liveable for Taqi and other children.

‘Still we are feeling guilty as we have been failed to ensure trial of the Taqi’s killers,’ he said.

Terming the murder a political killing, Taqi’s father Rafiur Rabbi warned that the killers and people hindering the trial would be punished by the general people someday.

Santras Nirmul Taqi Mancha member secretary Halim Azad, Bangladesh Udichi Shilpi Goshthi president Shafiuddin Ahmed and museum trustee Mafidul Haque, among others, were present.

Taqi, an A-level student went missing on March 6, 2013. After two days, his body, bearing several wounds, was found floating on the river Sitalakhya.

One of the murder suspects, Sawkat, reportedly made his statement before a court on November 12, 2013 saying that Azmeri Osman, nephew of ruling Awami League lawmaker Shamim Osman, planned and executed the murder.

Rapid Action Battalion officials, the investigating agency in the murder case, had also informed media that they were close to submitting charge sheet against 11 suspects including Azmeri.

The charge sheet was yet to be submitted.
