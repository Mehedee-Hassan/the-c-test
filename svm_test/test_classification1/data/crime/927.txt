Couple get life term for murdering child
A Barisal court on Monday sentenced a couple to life imprisonment for murdering a child of their neighbour in 2008.

They were also fined Tk 50,000 each.

Tribunal for preventing torture against women and children judge Sheikh Abu Taher announced the verdict after examining 18 witnesses.

The tribunal bench clerk Ajibor Rahman said that the two convicted — Saidur Rahman Sayed and his wife Tanjila Rahman Tania — had remained absconding during announcement of the verdict.

According to the case complaint, Haidar Ali lodged a general diary with Wazirpur police after his daughter Hafiza, 4, of village Kalna under Wazirpur upazila in Barisal, went missing on August 11, 2008.

Two days later, he received a phone call that asked for Tk 2 lakh in return for the child. Then, with the help of the police, the body of the child was recovered on the same day.

Haidar then lodged a murder case accusing Sayed and Tania.

Sub-inspector Mizanul Huq, investigation officer of the case, submitted the charge-sheet against the accused couple on October 20, 2008.
