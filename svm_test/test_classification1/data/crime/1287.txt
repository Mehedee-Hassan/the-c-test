Cop suspended on bribery charges
A sub-inspector of Tejgaon Industrial Area Police Station was suspended yesterday for allegedly taking bribes from a CNG-run autorickshaw owner.

Chowdhury Manjurul Kabir, deputy commissioner of DMP Tejgaon zone, suspended Sub-Inspector Humayun Kabir.

He told The Daily Star that Sub-Inspector Humayun seized an autorickshaw on charges that a gang of extortionists was using it. But the sub-inspector demanded bribes when the owner of the autorickshaw came to take the three-wheeler back.

Sources said a victim of a mugging filed a case few weeks ago and mentioned the number of the autorickshaw used by the muggers. That number matched with the number of autorickshaw seized by Sub-inspector Humayun, who was the investigation officer of the case.
