Bangladesh Bank Governor Atiur Rahman today warned of stern action against those involved in the looting of Tk 60 lakh by breaking a vault of the Janata Bank in Gazipur.

“Stern action must be taken against the burglars and the bank employees if found involved with the incident,” the central bank chief made the warning while chairing a meeting of bankers at BB in Dhaka this afternoon.

He also asked the authorities concerned to inform him about the progress in this regard within seven days.

Earlier on Saturday night, burglars looted Tk 60 lakh from the Gazipur corporate branch of the state-owned bank at Joydevpur on Saturday night, UNB adds.

Police arrested security guard of the bank Nurul Islam, 50, following the incident.

Officer in-charge of Joydevpur Police Station Syed Abul Hasem said, Zakir, a cloth trader of Tanvir Plaza at Joydevepur Bazar, entered the bank, housed on the second floor of the same market, tactfully with some fruits around 10 pm on Saturday.

When the security guard fell unconscious after eating the fruits, Zakir and his accomplices broke open the vault and looted the money. They fled the scene breaking a window grill.

Earlier on January 25, burglars had tunneled into the vault of Sonali Bank's main branch in Kishoreganj district town and looted about Tk 16.40 crore.

Barely in one and a half months of similar incident in Kishoreganj, burglars in a filmy style looted Tk 32.51 lakh from another branch of Sonali Bank in Bogra after digging a tunnel into its vault on March 8.
