Repression against women to go on if perps not punished
Women will continue to be oppressed in Bangladesh unless the government takes stern action against perpetrators like the kidnappers of indigenous leader Kalpana Chakma, said speakers at a meeting yesterday.

The meeting was organised demanding the government make public the probe report of the kidnapping of Kalpana Chakma, the then leader of Hill Women's Federation. Kalpana was abducted on June 12, 1996 -- allegedly by members of security forces.

Different organisations, including Hill Women's Federation, Nari Progati, Bangladesh Mahila Parishad and Bangladesh Indigenous Women's Network, organised the programme on the Central Shaheed Minar premises in the capital on the 19th anniversary of Kalpana's kidnapping.

The speakers mentioned that the government has failed to make visible progress in the case even 19 years into the abduction.

The speakers also demanded implementation of the CHT peace accord.

They claimed law enforcers involved in the abduction are still in service.

Pankaj Bhattacharya, convener of Nagorik Oikya; Sanjeeb Drong, general secretary of Bangladesh Indigenous Peoples' Forum; Rokeya Kabir, executive director of Nari Progati; Maleka Banu, general secretary of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad; and indigenous leaders Daipayan Chakma, Chaitali Tripura and Chanchana Chakma spoke at the programme.
