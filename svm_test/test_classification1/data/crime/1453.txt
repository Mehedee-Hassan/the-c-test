Juba Dal leader shot dead in Khulna
A Jatiyatabadi Juba Dal leader was shot to death as the villagers tried to resist a group of armed men allegedly belonging to ruling Awami League’s student front Bangladesh Chattra League at Kuria of Batiyaghata in Khulna who went there to grab a shrimp enclosure Sunday evening.

The dead was identified as Nazrul Islam, 42, son of Ain Uddin of Kuria. He was the general secretary of Amirpur union unit of Juba Dal, the youth front of opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, said Batiyaghata upazila unit of BNP.

Locals alleged that an armed group of 15 to 20 people led by Khulna city BCL president SM Asaduzzaman Rasel by motorcycles went to Kuria village to grab a shrimp enclosure, locally known as Atalir Gher, under Batiyaghata while a group of villagers tried to resist them around 7:00pm.

They alleged that as both the groups became face to face, Rasel’s associates opened fire on the protesters and Nazrul and another villager Nizam Uddin, 42, became injured.

The attackers then fled away by motorcycles by opening blank fires leaving the duo in a pool of blood, they said.

They said that the villagers immediately rushed the spot, rescued them and took them to KMCH where doctors declared Nazrul dead at around 8:15pm. Nizam is now undergoing treatment at the hospital.

An attending doctor at the emergency department said Nazrul received bullet in his chest and was brought dead to the hospital.

Khulna city BCL president SM Asaduzzaman Rasel could not be reached for comments after several attempts Sunday night.

The Batiyaghata police station officer in charge said Nazrul was killed in a clash between two groups of AL men over grabbing a shrimp enclosure.
