2 ‘muggers’ killed in Ctg bomb blast
Two alleged robbers were killed when a crude bomb hurled by the duo while mugging exploded in Chittagong city last night.

Shatya Gopal Bhoumik, who became victim of the muggers, was shot by the gang. Bhoumik rushed to Chittagong Medical College Hospital where he underwent an operation, reports our Chittagong correspondent.

Besides, six other people received splinter injuries during the incident. Morzina Akter, inspector (investigation) of Sadarghat Police Station, said the muggers riding a motorcycle waylaid Bhoumik at Majhirghat when he was returning home around 11:30pm.

They shot Bhoumik and snatched the money, the police officer said. When people present there tried to resist the snatchers, they hurled several crude bombs.

But one of the bombs went off close to them, leaving one dead on the spot. On information, police rushed to the spot, found another bullet-hit mugger in a nearby drain and took him to CMCH where he died later.

The law enforcers recovered a bag containing Tk 5:40 lakh cash and two firearms from his possession. The motorcycle used by the muggers was also seized.

Bhoumik is a manager of a business organisation named Saha Corporation.
