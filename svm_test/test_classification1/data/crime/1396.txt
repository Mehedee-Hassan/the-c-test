DU teacher sacked on sexual assault charges
A Dhaka University teacher has been sacked following an accusation of sexual harassment of a student of his department.

Dr Amran Hossain, an associate professor of political science department, was previously sent on forced leave in 2011 after he was accused of this charge.

The decision was taken at a syndicate meeting last night as the allegation against him has been proven true, Syndicate member and president of DU Teacher’s association Dr Maksud Kamal told The Daily Star today.

Meanwhile, the meeting also suspended Md Omor Faruk, an assistant professor of Islamic history and culture department, on charges of plagiarising his PhD Thesis from the research of two Turkish professors, Dr Maksud Kamal said.

A five-member committee led by the pro-VC of Dhaka University has been formed to investigate the incident and understand the gravity of the misconduct after the Turkish professors informed the department of the issue.
