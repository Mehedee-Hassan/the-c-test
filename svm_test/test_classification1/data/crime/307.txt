Afghan forces search for kidnapped aid workers
Authorities were Saturday searching for two French aid workers kidnapped in central Afghanistan, but the Taliban denied capturing them.

The Action Against Hunger (Action Contre la Faim) workers were taken from their guest house in the early hours of Friday in the central province of Day Kundi, their Paris-based organisation has said.

"We have no news on their fate," provincial governor Sultan Ali Uruzgani told AFP. "Our security forces have been searching for them."

The interior ministry in the capital Kabul said it did not know who had taken them.

"Day Kundi does not see a strong infiltration of insurgents and terrorists," ministry spokesman Zemarai Bashary told AFP.
