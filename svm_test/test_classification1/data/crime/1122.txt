Indiscriminate vandalism of vehicles protested
Social Workers' Forum yesterday protested indiscriminate vandalism of vehicles in the city's Mohakhali, Gulshan and Banani areas on Saturday.

The vehicles were vandalised after a rumour about the death of a college girl had spread in the areas.

At a human chain at the Central Shaheed Minar in the city, leaders of the Forum called upon everyone to deal every affair with patience and act logically in every crisis.

“There must be a practice of handling every matter through negotiation if any problem occurs,” they said.

They also urged the government to take necessary steps to stop such vindictive activities and asked the law enforcers to take actions if it deems necessary.

They added that such incidents bring suffering to public life and incur a huge loss on our economy.

“So, for the sake of ourselves, we should not let such things happen in the future,” they also said.
