Hundreds of passengers got stuck in a 48-kilometre tailback on the Dhaka-Chittagong highway since last night following the blockade and vandalism in Chittagong by the activists of BNP and its key ally Jamaat-e-Islami.

They went on rampage after police arrested BNP leaders Moudud Ahmed, MK Anwar and Rafiqul Islam Miah in the capital yesterday.

Some 40 vehicles were torched and vandalised at Barab Kunda, Kumira and Baro Aulia in Sitakunda upazila around 10:45pm, which triggered the traffic jam, said Syed Zakir Hossain, officer-in-charge of Baro Aulia highway police outpost.

Law enforces started removing the damaged vehicles from the highway from 8:00am today, the police official said.

Commuters specially the office-goers and examinees of Junior School Certificate and Junior Dakhil Certificate examinations had to suffer a lot in the severe jam, reports our district correspondent.

The agitating BNP-Jamaat activists last night also blocked the Dhaka-Chittagong highway between Sitakunda and Faujdarhat, leaving many vehicles stranded.

Police fired several bullets to disperse the agitating BNP-Jamaat men.
