Verdict against Shariatpur war crimes suspect any day
The three-judge International Crimes Tribunal-1 on Wednesday announced that it would deliver the verdict in Shariatpur war crimes case any day.

Shariatpur war crimes accused Edris Ali Sarder alias Gazi Edris, 67, is absconding.

The schedule was announced by ICT-1 chairman, Justice Anwarul Haque at a full court hearing.

This would be the 27th verdict in as many war crimes cases in independent Bangladesh.

It would be ICT-1’s 16th verdict.

In 1971, Edris from Mahmudpur, Shariatpur was a leader of Islami Chattra Sangha, as the student wing of Jamaat was then called.

He joined the Razakar force and committed crimes against humanity, according to the prosecution.

He was tried in absentia on four counts of crimes against humanity.

He committed the crimes at different places under the then Palang police station under the then Madaripur sub-division and Madaripur town.

He was tried on the charges of committing genocide, raping, abduction, torture in confinement, carrying out arson attacks and looting.

Summing up his rebuttal, prosecutor Hrishikesh Saha prayed for the highest punishment for the accused prescribed by the law.

State defence lawyer Gazi MH Tamim sought acquittal for Edris on the plea that his client was away from the crime spots.

On May 2, Edris of Paschim Kashabhog and Sulaiman Mollah, 84, of Kashipur Muslimpara of Shariatpur were indicted.

Sulaiman, a Muslim League leader in 1971 who joined Peace Committee and the Razakar Bahini, died in jail on October 25.

At the trial stage, 13 prosecution witnesses gave evidence against the accused.

The defence produced no witness.
