Police lift day curfew in riot-hit Hyderabad
After more than a week of tension, people in parts of communally sensitive Hyderabad breathed easier yesterday with curfew being relaxed from 8 am to 5 pm.

Amid massive security arrangements, life returned to near normalcy in the old city and other areas, which were rocked by communal violence last week.

Police Commissioner AK Khan, however, warned that any untoward incident would lead to re-imposition of the curfew.

Police said propitiatory orders banning assembly of five or more people would continue across the city and asked public leaders not to visit-riot hit areas. Pillion riding on two-wheelers has also been banned between 11 pm and 6 am.

Khan told reporters that night curfew would continue till the situation completely returned to normal.

Indefinite curfew was imposed March 29 in all 17 police stations areas of the old city and on March 30 in eight police station areas of the new city following communal clashes.
