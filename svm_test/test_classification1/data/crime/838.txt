Russia’s president Vladimir Putin said on Monday that the killing of its ambassador to Turkey was a provocation to try to spoil Russia-Turkey ties and derail Moscow's attempts to find, with Iran and Turkey, a solution for the Syria crisis.

In televised comments, Putin, speaking at a special meeting in the Kremlin, ordered security at Russian embassies around the world to be stepped up and said he wanted to know who had ‘directed’ the gunman's hand.
