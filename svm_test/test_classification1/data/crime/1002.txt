Scourge of dowry




I was amazed to notice no protest from the readers; despite numerous news reports on housewives being killed by husbands & in-laws, due to non-receipt of committed dowries. Thank you Md. Tanjil, from the dept. of Geography and Environmental Studies, University of Chittagong, for writing against this social evil (source: The Daily Star, 03-05-2010). It usually happens among very poor citizens, living in remote villages. There is nobody to listen to them.

I would urge the women's rights organisations and law enforcers to work together and banish dowry, once and for all.
