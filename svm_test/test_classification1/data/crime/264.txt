Pak oil co chief kidnapped
KARACHI, Jan 24: Two unidentified gunmen kidnapped the president of Pakistan's largest oil and natural gas exploration company in the southern city of Karachi, the spokesman for a citizen/police committee said today, reports AP.

Syed Munsif Raza, 53, chief executive of Pakistan Petroleum Limited was kidnapped Saturday while shopping in an eastern neighbourhood of Karachi, said Jamil Yousuf, chairman of the Citizen-Police Liaison Committee, a 10-year-old joint committee of police and citizens established to curb crime in Pakistan's largest city of Karachi.

The kidnappers apparently took Raza in his own vehicle.

So far police have no suspects, nor has anyone contacted Raza's family with demands, he said.

Pakistan Petroleum Limited's gasfields are located in southwestern Baluchistan province, while its crude oil fields are mainly in southern Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital.
