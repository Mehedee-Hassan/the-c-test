Deceased Yakub Ali and Kamrul Hasan were involved in the robbery at Shamim Jewellers shop in Baroiarhat Bazar in the upazila on February 26, our Chittagong correspondent reports quoting Lt Col Miftah Uddin Ahmed, commanding (CO) officer of Rab-7.

The duo was seen looting jewellery from the shop in the CCTV footages collected after the robbery, Lt Col Miftah said.

Acting on a tip-off, a team of Rab-7 conducted a drive at Muhuri Project area under Jorarganj Police Station around 4:00am when a group of “robbers” were preparing to commit robbery at the shop there, the Rab official said.

Sensing the Rab men's presence, the gang opened fire on the elite force. Then, the law enforcers retaliated with gunfire, triggering the “gunfight”, he claimed.

The bodies of Yakub and Kamrul were found on the spot after the gunfight, he added.

The elite force members also recovered eight firearms, bullets and sharp weapons from the spot.
