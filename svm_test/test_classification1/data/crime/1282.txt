2 Danida officials charge-sheeted for 'bribery'
Police submitted charge sheet against two Danida officials with the Judicial Magistrate's Court here on Monday in a bribery case filed with the first class magistrate's court on June 5 last year.

The Danida officials are Md Sirajul Islam, manager (administration & finance) and Md Emdad Hossain, monitoring and evaluation officer of Patuakhali Aquaculture and Livestock Extension Project.

Sadar police station officer-in-charge (OC) Sheikh Delwar Hossain submitted the charge sheet.

Hafiz-Al-Masud filed the case against the two.

He said the accused demanded Tk 1.5 lakh from plaintiff Hafiz-Al-Masud promising job to his brother Hafiz-Al-Asad in the project.

Masud gave them Tk 70,000. As they failed to make any progress to fulfil their commitment, he demanded return of the money. But they declined.

Finding no alternative, Masud filed the case against them.
