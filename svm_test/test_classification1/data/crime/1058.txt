"Sexual harassment by teacher"
The Daily Star has published a number of letters from concerned citizens regarding sexual harassment by teachers. No doubt, if such heinous activities are actually taking place in our educational institutions, then those should be properly handled by the administration. However, after reading a letter on the topic, which was published on September 25, I actually had to wonder if some letter writers were confusing 'failed relationship with teacher' with 'sexual harassment'. Unfortunately, that's the impression I got after reading Nasrin Pervin's letter published on September 12, 2008. According to the writer, her friend was having a long relationship with her teacher and when the teacher backed out (for whatever reason it might be), then it automatically became a 'sexual harassment by the teacher', just because the guy who was flirting with her friend was a teacher by profession.

I think it was a very narrow conclusion.
