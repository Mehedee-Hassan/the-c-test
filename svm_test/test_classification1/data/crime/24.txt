Two thieves caught while fleeing
Angry mob beat two thieves while fleeing after looting valuables from a journalist's residence at Azimpur in the city yesterday.

The criminals entered the house of Crime Reporters' Association of Bangladesh (CRAB) President Parvez Khan breaking the door lock around 1:30pm.

Family sources said, when Parvez's wife returned home bringing her daughter from the school, she found the lock broken. Hearing her cry for help, the thieves tried to flee but local people caught them and recovered the ornaments and cash from them.
