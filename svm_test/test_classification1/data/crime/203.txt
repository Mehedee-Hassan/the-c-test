MKA admits Yaba smuggling alarming
Home Minister Muhiuddin Khan Alamgir yesterday termed alarming the situation of Yaba being smuggled into Bangladesh across the Naf river from Myanmar.

"We have intensified patrolling in the river to contain the Yaba trafficking. We will also request Myanmar's authorities to prevent such trafficking on the opposite bank of the river," he told reporters after a meeting on narcotics control at his ministry.

The minister described delay in adjudicating drug cases as a hindrance in the fight against the drug trade. Only 7.5 percent of around 55,000 drug cases filed annually in the country reach verdicts, he said, adding that in the adjudicated cases, 47 percent of the accused get acquitted.

Alamgir expressed dissatisfaction over the number of arrests, given the high number of drug peddlers and addicts.

Asked about ruling party men's alleged involvement in smuggling in Yaba from Myanmar, he said that while making arrests, law enforces did not consider one's political identity.

Alamgir said the health ministry had an important role to play as almost 72 percent of the addicts took sedatives.
