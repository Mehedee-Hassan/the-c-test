Assault on Mirpur twins: Prime accused held
Rapid Action Battalion have arrested the main accused in a case filed over beating up teenage twin sisters in Dhaka’s Mirpur area on October 19 for protesting abusive language used by him.

A team of Rab-4 conducted the drive and picked up Jibon Karim alias Babu, according to a text message send to media by Rab today.

Local businessmen earlier identified the attacker as Babu, owner of Ahona Fast Food and Khabar Hotel in the area.

The 16-year-old sisters, who are HSC students of BCIC College on Chiriakhana Road, came under attack around 11:30am on that day when they were returning home from the college.

All of a sudden a man, aged about 30, hurled abuse at her. As she glanced back, the man became furious, used abusive words and slapped her on the face.

Seeing the incident, her twin came forward to save her, but this only infuriated the attacker. The man slapped and kicked the twins.

Trying to get away from the attacker, the duo ran towards the college gate. The man followed them, picked up a bamboo stick and hit the siblings with it.

As a few college students tried to subdue the assaulter, some 10 men took up the cudgels for the attacker to keep the students at bay, said Meem.

A little later, students took the injured girls to the principal's room. The principal sent the two to National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedic Rehabilitation (Pongu Hospital).

On the following day, teachers and fellow students formed a human chain in front of the college demanding exemplary punishment of the attacker.
