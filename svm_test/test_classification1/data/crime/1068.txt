Sexual harassment by teachers
The incidents of sexual harassment ( of students by teachers) in Rajshahi, Dhaka, BUET, Jahangirnagar and other universities have occurred over the decades, reminding us how little we have done to ensure the security of female students on campus.

The students and the Civil Society are now trying to force the authorities to make stringent rules to prevent this type of incidents. But the authorities seem to be acting otherwise. A recent news item shows that a convicted professor guilty of sexual harassment has been rewarded by the authorities.

Tainted persons should not be selected for even symbolic national positions. The issue should be taken socially and the culprits must be cornered.
