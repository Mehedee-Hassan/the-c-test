DSHE staff caught on bribery charge
Education Minister Nurul Islam Nahid, in a surprise visit to the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) yesterday, caught one of its employees red handed on a bribery charge.

He asked the DSHE director general to take immediate action against the accused, Monirul Islam, office assistant cum computer operator of secondary branch, who demanded Tk 12,000 as bribe from a school headmaster.

Around 11:00am, Nahid visited the Shikkhha Bhaban and witnessed the allegation of Badrul Hossain, assistant headmaster of Rastarhat Hazi A Gafur High School in Laxmipur.

Badrul alleged that he has been requesting Monirul for changing his (Badrul's) index for the past four months, but Monirul did not do the work and rather demanded Tk 12,000 for it.

Monirul was instantly transferred to Rani Nihar Devi Government High School in Khagrachhari following the education minister's order.

Nahid also talked to the officials, employees and teachers who came to the directorate for different job related tasks.

He warned that no one would be spared if any allegation of taking bribe for releasing office files is found against them.
