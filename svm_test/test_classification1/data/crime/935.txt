Six charges pressed against MP Hannan, seven others in war crimes case
The prosecution on Monday submitted formal charges against Jatiya Party MP from Mymensingh MA Hannan, 80, his son, and six other accused before the International Crimes Tribunal-1.

Prosecutor Zead-Al Malum and his colleagues pressed six charges against the suspects.

The suspects include Hannan’s son Mohammad Rafique Sajjad, 62, Khandakar Golam Sabbir Ahmed, Mizanur Rahman Mintu, Hormuj Ali, Mohammad Abdus Sattar, Mohammad Fakruzzaman, and Khandakar Golam Rabbani, all accused of committing war crimes in different areas of the greater Mymensingh district during the war of independence.

The tribunal led by Justice Anwarul Haque set December 11 to give the court’s decision if it would take the charges into cognizance.

The charges include murder, abduction, torture in confinement, looting, and arson attack.

Hannan is a sitting MP from Trishal and a presidium member of Jatiya Party faction led by former military dictator HM Ershad.

Sattar, Fakruzzaman, and Rabbani are still absconding, said prosecutor Rezia Sultana Chamon.
