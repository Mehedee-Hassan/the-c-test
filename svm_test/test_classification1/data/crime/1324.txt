Framed Bangladesh Bank official recalls 'cop brutality'
What does a commoner do when a policeman, who is oath-bound to provide security to people, points his gun at him to squeeze money out of his pocket?

Have nothing to do other than feeling utterly helpless. Golam Rabby, an assistant director of Bangladesh Bank, learnt it the hard way.

Saturday night he was returning home from one of his relatives’ house in Mohammadpur.

It was then that Sub-inspector Masud Shikder’s “hungry eyes” fell upon him when he was walking on Tajmahal Road after withdrawing money from an ATM booth.

The SI and some constables intercepted the BB official while he was returning home around 11:00pm, Rabbi, also a former news anchor at a private television channel, claimed.

They also allegedly threatened to implicate him in narcotic and arms cases. They even threatened to shoot him to force him to pay the money.
