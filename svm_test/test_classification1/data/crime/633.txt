Impunity in Rajuk
There are a few organisations in the country whose name is synonymous with corruption. Our capital development authority is one such. And the report carried in this paper yesterday explains why that is so.

Not only is there any attempt to root out corruption which is manifestly pervasive in the organisation, it seems that there are deliberate efforts to breed it also. Otherwise how does one explain the fact that a person under inquiry for forging of signatures of his superiors and getting the plans for a high rise building approved fraudulently can be selected for a tour when he should have been suspended for his action? How does one explain the fact that the probe has taken 10 months to be completed when it was supposed to be done in 15 days? And even then the head of the organisation has been sitting on it for two weeks when it should have been sent for administrative action within three days of its receipt. The dilly-dallying is inexplicable.

This particular case is fairly representative of the kind of corruption that pervades Rajuk. While, admittedly, corruption may be difficult to eradicate from the society altogether, what is debilitating for the nation is that senior members of organisations and persons in authority abet such crimes and in fact encourage corruption by not taking action as per law.

The government should take cognizance of such corrupt practices and take stringent measures against those that commit and those that abet corruption in order to cleanse these organisations.
