Vandalism for nationalisation of Barguna college
Students of Patharghata Degree College in Barguna today vandalised college property and confined its principal demanding immediate nationalisation of the institution.

Starting from around 9:30am, hundreds of agitated students vandalised windowpanes and furniture of the classrooms, our Patuakhali correspondent reports.

At one stage, they confined the college’s principal at office around 10:00am, said SM Ziaul Haque, officer-in-charge of Patharghata Police Station.

“We rushed there and brought the situation under control and additional police have also been deployed to avert any further untoward situation,” he added.

As per government policy, one education institution in each upazila will be nationalised. Barguna’s Patharghata Degree College, established over 30 years ago, is still awaiting the status.
