Two boys kidnapped
An anonymous caller has phoned guardians of two minor children demanding Tk 3 lakh as ransom for release of their sons who were abducted from Singsri village at Dhamrai on Friday.

Omi, 5, son of Badaruddin Master, and Nahid alias, Babu, 6, son of Shukur Ali were found missing since Friday noon.

Fathers of the minor boys suspect that Al-Amin, 26, of Khakerhat village in Deviganj upazila of Panchagarh district was behind the kidnap. Al Amin was a domestic help of their brother Safaruddin four years ago.

Al-Amin returned to the village for reason unknown and took the children to a nearby shop at about noon to give them chocolate. Since then they were missing.

Police were informed about the kidnap and the telephone call for ransom with threat of killing the minor children.

Their guardians along with police went to Deviganj yesterday evening to investigate if Al Amin was involved in the kidnapping.
