Faruque's graft led to Tk 255cr embezzlement at Proshika
Corruption and irregularities by ousted chairman Qazi Faruque Ahmed has led to embezzlement of Tk 255 crore at Proshika, one of Bangladesh's pioneering private development organisations, said a section of employees yesterday.

“We demand immediate removal of Qazi Faruque Ahmed, who has been forcibly occupying the organisation's head office in violation of a High Court order,” said Deputy Chief Executive Md Sirajul Islam.

Faruque has brought the once-vibrant Proshika Manobik Unnyan Kendra, founded in 1976, to the brink of ruination with massive financial corruption, administrative anarchy and political ambition, the convener of Proshika restoration committee told a press conference in the capital's Dhaka Reporters Unity.

Faruque, however, said all the allegations were “unfounded”, claiming he has audits on all the financial transactions.

In May 2009, eight of the nine-member governing body of Proshika, one of the country's largest NGOs, removed Faruque on allegations of massive financial and administrative irregularities and abusing Proshika for political gain and nepotism.

They appointed Abdul Wadud in his place and Mahbub-ul-Karim as chief executive officer, which the High Court allowed in an observation.

But in the early morning of May 20, 2012, Faruque took control of the head office with the help of a group loyal to him. A case he filed is still pending.

Faruque said the High Court rejected a petition stating he intruded Proshika in violation of an earlier directive.

Directors Md Sirajul Haque and Qamrul Islam Kamal and Deputy Director Md Insar Ali Pasha were present.
