2 Rajuk officials held for signature forgery
Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) today arrested two officials of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) in Dhaka on a charge of signature fraudulent.

A team of ACC led by its Deputy Director SM Rafiqul Islam arrested Rajuk’s authorised officers Mizanur Rahman and Shukamal Chakma in Segunbagicha area of the capital this afternoon, Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya, public relations officer of ACC, told The Daily Star.

The duo have given approval to construction work of a 19-storey building with four basements at Kamal Ataturka Avinue (plot-35, 37) through forging signatures of Rajuk Approval Committee Chairman Sheikh Abdul Mannan and its member Golam Mostafa, the ACC official said.

A case was lodged with Banani Police Station against them in this connection.
