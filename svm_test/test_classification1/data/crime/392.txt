Credit card fraud held
Detectives on Thursday night arrested a youth in the capital on charges of using other people's bank account through fake debit and credit cards.

The arrestee was identified as Nur-e-Alam alias Babu, 26, of Thakurgaon district.

Law enforcers also recovered 15 debit and credit cards of different private banks -- none of those issued to the arrestee -- and 15 fake seals of government and private organisations from Nur-e-Alam.

Sources said a team of the Detective Branch led by its Assistant Commissioner (AC) Asaduzzaman opted for the arrest following a complaint from Rafiqul Islam, owner of a stationery shop in Gulshan area.

According to the allegation, Nur-e-Alam had a credit card issued against Rafiqul Islam's bank account by furnishing all his [Rafiqul's] particulars, including his signature, and providing necessary documents with fake seals and authentication of the officials concerned.

AC Asaduzzaman said Nur-e-Alam used friendship as his weapon. He tried to manage bank account number and bank statements of his victims and used their signatures for the felony.

He said, “Nur-e-Alam managed to befool the banks lacking in proper verification and information sharing system.”

DB filed a case against Nur-e-Alam with North Gulshan Police Station and produced him before a court yesterday seeking seven days' remand.
