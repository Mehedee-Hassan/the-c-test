Paraguay rioters set fire to Congress
A protester was killed in Paraguay after a secret Senate vote for a constitutional amendment that would allow President Horacio Cartes to run for re-election sparked violent clashes and the country's Congress was stormed and set alight.

Rodrigo Quintana, 25, was killed by a rubber bullet fired by police in the headquarters of the liberal youth activist group, the Paraguayan opposition said.

The interior ministry said in a statement an investigation into Quintana's death would be opened. His doctor said he had suffered a severe head injury.

Activists were arriving in Paraguay's capital Asuncion yesterday from the landlocked country's interior in a sign the violent protests that resulted in a fire in the first floor of Congress on Friday could continue.

Cartes called for calm and a rejection of violence in a statement released on Twitter. He promised the government would do its best to maintain order.

Firefighters managed to control the flames after protesters left the building late on Friday, although protests and riots continued in other parts of Asuncion and elsewhere in the country into the early hours of yesterday.

Around 200 protesters were detained and 30 injured, police said, and shops and government buildings were vandalized.
