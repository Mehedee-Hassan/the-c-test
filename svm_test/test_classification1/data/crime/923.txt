Man gets death penalty for rape, murder
A man has received death penalty for the rape and murder of a 15-year-old girl in Dhaka.

The Judge of Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunal-3, Jayasri Samaddar, on Wednesday handed down the punishment to the convict, who had tried to escape the crime scene by cutting the victim’s body into more than 20 pieces and throwing those out of window.

The convict, Mohammad Saiduzzaman Bachchu, from Madhukhali upazila of Faridpur, remains at large after receiving bail from the High Court on October 26, 2016.

The tribunal also fined him Tk one lakh and issued a warrant for his arrest.

According to the case statement, Saiduzzaman Bachchu, owner of Sonali Tours and Travels Company housed at the 12th floor of Nahar Plaza building at Hatirpool area in Dhaka, got into a love affair with Roksana Akter Rumi of Faridpur in 2010 over telephone.

He took the girl to his office and raped her on June 1, 2012.

Saiduzzaman Bacchu, later, asphyxiated the girl to death and dismembered the body into a total of 26 pieces. He threw the pieces outside of his office through windows.

People in and around gathered near the building after they had found the body pieces. They suspected Bacchu and forced him to stay inside. Later, they called the police who went to the scene on June 2, 1012 and picked him up.

Body pieces were recovered from the nearby alley and from the roof of an adjacent building. Shahbag police sub-inspector Abdus Samad filed a case citing Bachchu as the lone accused.
