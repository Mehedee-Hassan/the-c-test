Suspended cop sent to jail for blackmailing woman
A Kushtia court sent a suspended sub-inspector to jail after rejecting his bail prayer on Thursday in a case filed under the pornography act.

Mominul Islam, while posted in Kushtia Police Lines, took nude photographs of a medical student after spiking her drink on June 6, 2012 and blackmailed her for four years for making physical relationship with him, said Ratan Seikh, court inspector of Kushtia. Being angry over her marriage in this January, Mominul showed the pictures to her husband which resulted in their divorce in April.

The girl filed a case against Mominul on April 19 and he was suspended on April 29.
