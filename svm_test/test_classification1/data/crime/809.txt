Two killed over robbery in Sylhet
Two people were killed — one in an attack by robbers and another during a clash with police over a robbery — at village Mostafanagar of Companiganj upazila in Sylhet on Saturday morning.

The victims were identified as Jilu Miah, 55, a resident of Mostafanagar, and Mafiz Miah, 50, of village Rajnagar in the same upazila.

A gang of robbers broke into the house of Jilu Miah at the dead of night and held hostage its inmates and looted valuables, said upazila nirbahi officer Abul Lais.

At one stage, the robbers stabbed Jilu as the house inmates tried to resist them, leaving him dead on the spot.

Hearing screams of the house inmates, local people rushed in and caught one of the suspected robbers, Sonai Miah, while trying to flee. His other associates, however, managed to escape.

Later, a clash broke out between two groups of villagers around 7:00am over Sonai Mia's capture in connection with the robbery.

On information, a team of police led by Abdur Rakib, sub-inspector of Companiganj police station, rushed in around 9:00am.

As the locals turned furious, the law enforcers opened fire, leaving Mafiz Miah dead on the spot and 50 others injured.

The injured were taken to Companiganj Upazila Health Complex.

Altaf Hossain, officer-in-charge of the police station, confirmed only Jilu's death by robbers.



‘I heard the death of another villager in a clash with police over the issue,’ the police official added.
