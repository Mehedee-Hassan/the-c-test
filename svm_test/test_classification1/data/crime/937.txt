Verdict of Shariatpur war crimes suspect any day
International Crimes Tribunal 1 on Wednesday said that it would deliver the verdict in war crimes case against Shariatpur suspect Idris Ali Sardar, 67, any day.

The tribunal led by justice Anowarul Haque passed the order on completion of hearing both the sides.

The tribunal earlier indicted Idris and Solaiman Malla, 84, for committing crimes against humanity during the liberation war in 1971.

But on October 25, Solaiman died in jail.

The duo faced four war crimes charges.

The prosecution produced 13 witnesses, took to prove the charges but the defence produced none.
