Barapukuria graft: Khaleda asked to appear before court July 24
A Dhaka court today asked BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia and 10 others to appear before it on July 24 in connection with the Barapukuria coalmine corruption case.

Judge Hosneara Begum of Special Judge’s Court-2 passed the order after getting a High Court order that had cleared the way for the lower court concerned to run the trial proceedings.

The order came after a public prosecutor submitted a petition to run the trial proceedings.

The HC on May 25 released its full judgement, directing the trial court to proceed with the corruption case.

On that day, the court also vacated its 2008 stay order on the case proceedings.

On September 17 last year, the HC bench of Justice Md Nuruzzaman and Justice Abdur Rob rejected a writ petition filed by the BNP chief in 2008 challenging the legality of trial proceedings in the case filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) earlier that year.

The ACC accuses the former prime minister and 15 others of causing a loss of Tk 159 crores to the state exchequer by awarding a contract for operation of Barapukuria coalmine to a Chinese company between June 2003 and June 2005, abusing power.
