The Supreme Court today upheld death for Jamaat-e-Islami leader Mir Quasem Ali in the appeal verdict of a war crimes case. He was acquitted in three charges, including one from a death penalty.

A five-member full bench of Appellate Division, headed by Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha delivered the short verdict before a packed courtroom at 9:42am.

The apex court upheld Quasem’s death for murder of a freedom fighter Jasim. He was acquitted for murdering Ranjit Das and Tuntu Sen, abduction, two counts of abduction, confinement and torture of Saifuddin Khan and Harunur Rashid Khan.

Quasem Ali, 63, a member of Jamaat-e-Islami's central executive council and considered by many as a top financier of the anti-liberation party, handed death by a special tribunal in 2014 for war crimes.

On February 24, the apex court fixed today for delivering the verdict on his appeal.
