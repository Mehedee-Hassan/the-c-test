‘Curbing cattle smuggling can stop border killing’
About ninety five percent of the killings on Bangladesh-India border occur due to cattle smuggling, said Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) today.

“If we can stop the cattle smuggling, border killings can be stopped,” said BGB Director General (DG), Major General Aziz Ahmed at a press conference at its headquarters in Dhaka around 10:00am.

He was briefing journalists about the outcome of the 43rd Border Conference between Bangladesh and India held in New Delhi from September 30 to October 5.

Issues like Yaba smuggling, human trafficking and transnational crimes were also discussed between the two countries during the conference where 22 Bangladeshi high officials, lead by the BGB director general, represented the country.



A list of twelve thousand criminals was handed over to India on behalf of Bangladesh during the conference, Major General Aziz Ahmed told reporters.



New Delhi agreed to monitor cattle smuggling as the cattle is being smuggled from India, the DG also said.



India also agreed to work on handing over Bangladeshi prisoners to the country soon, the DG added.
