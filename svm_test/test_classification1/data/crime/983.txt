Sexual harassment in educational institutions
Sexual harassment of female students by their teachers in our educational institutions all over the country is common, which shocks us very much and tarnishes the image of the particular institutions as well as the teaching profession. The teachers who are involved in sexual harassment lack morality and principles. They have stigmatised the noble teaching profession. I cannot imagine how a teacher can sexually harass female students.

Sexual abuse both by male students and teachers in different universities of Bangladesh has become a matter of concern. From my experience as a student of one of the public universities, I can say that this has been going on for quite a long time. What I am disturbed by is that I know many teachers of many departments of my university who tried to develop relationships with young innocent students who held extremely inflated impressions about these teachers. Exploiting their feelings, these teachers can readily weigh up some of the girls' vulnerability. This is seduction in the true sense of the term and the question is: isn't it sexual abuse too? While most young girls involved in such relations nurture their romanticism and dream, the teachers just have fun with them and forget everything. Later, the girls suffer from both frustration and trauma. I am writing this because I am a witness to such incidents and I just want to share it with the readers.
