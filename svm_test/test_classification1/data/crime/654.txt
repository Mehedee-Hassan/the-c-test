Analysis: Catching sex offenders, good job Rab
It is a rare sense of relief to note that the Rab has been able to arrest two men in connection with the gang-rape of a young Garo woman a few days ago. The men have confessed to the felony and the law enforcers have been able to locate the microbus where this barbaric crime occurred.

It is still horrific to think that these men actually planned to rape this woman, days before they kidnapped and raped her. One of the rapists met her at the shop she worked in and made conversation with her, promising a lucrative job at a buying house and taking her phone number. This is how these beasts lured her into the microbus, gaining her trust first and then offering to drop her off at her home in Uttara, before they brutally tortured her.

There are no befitting words to describe the outrage and condemnation we feel regarding this horrible, abhorrent crime that must have left untold trauma on the victim. But this time the law enforcers have shown its efficiency and diligence in catching the rapists and unraveling their diabolical premeditated crime. For that we are appreciative of their sincere efforts and are convinced that they will be able to apprehend the other rapists. It also goes to show that it is possible for law enforcement agencies to find and apprehend such sexual offenders.

We cannot erase the painful memories this young woman will have to bear for the rest of her life. But at least we can expect that she will get some closure from knowing that her assaulters will be given the highest form of punishment. Let this expectation be materialised in real terms.
