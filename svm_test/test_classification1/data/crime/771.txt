Bank heist: Manager just got promotion letter
It was a happy start of the day for Waliullah Subin yesterday, having just received the letter of promotion he was longing for – elevation to senior executive.

He might have had plans to go home and treat his wife, sons and daughters in celebration last evening, but that is something no one will ever know now.

He has taken his celebration plans to the grave.

Executive officer in Bangladesh Commerce Bank’s Kathgora branch in Ashulia at the age of 40, Waliullah hailed from Nandia in Jamalpur.

April 21 began for him as special but ended for him with meeting his maker. Armed looters gunned him down inside his office in broad daylight.

“He had just gotten his promotion letter yesterday noon. He must have been happy,” Selim Hasan, senior vice-president of the bank, said.

His colleagues said Waliullah was a very hardworking man, adding that he had great contribution in setting up a branch of Bangladesh Commerce Bank there.

Waliullah’s namaj-e-janaza will be held at Bangladesh Commerce Bank central office in Dhaka today before burial in his native soil in Jamalpur.

He has left behind a wife, four sons and daughters, reports Bangla daily Prothom Alo.

Waliullah’s family will be compensated with around Tk 10 lakh, Abu Sadek Md Sohel, managing director of the Bangladesh Commerce Bank, told The Daily Star.

Families of other victims will be compensated Tk 1 lakh each from the Corporate Social Responsibility fund of Bangladesh Bank, he said.
