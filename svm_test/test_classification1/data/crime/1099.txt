Burglary at Kishoreganj Polytechnic
Criminals looted about Tk 63 thousand and vandalised furniture of the offices of the principal and the vice-principal and a few classrooms of Kishoreoreganj Polytechnic Institute on Wednesday night.

"Some 15-20 armed criminals entered the institute and beat me and Omar Faruq, another night guard last night [Wednesday]. Tying our hands from behind, they broke locks and vandalised furniture of different rooms," said Shihab Uddin, a night guard.

Engineer Abul Kalam Azad, acting principal of Kishoreganj Polytechnic Institute, said, “I cannot understand it. They took away 63 thousand and five hundred taka although there are many valuable instruments.”

Finding the two night guards injured and tied with rope yesterday morning, a few students took them to Karimganj health complex immediately.
