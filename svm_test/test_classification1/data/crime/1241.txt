Jamaican plane hijack drama ends
Police in Jamaica stormed a hijacked plane yesterday and arrested a lone gunman who had seized the Canadian airliner carrying 182 people during a stopover, the country's information minister told media.

Police captured the hijacker without firing any shots and no one was injured, minister Daryl Vaz said.

"It has ended the best way it could which is no fatalities, no injuries," Vaz told CBC. "Everybody is unharmed."

"And the six crew members have actually disembarked the plane and are now in the actual airport terminal," he said.

The armed youth, identified by officials only as from a Montego Bay family, allowed all passengers and two crew to leave the chartered CanJet Boeing 737, but was still holding six crew hours later at Montego Bay's Sangster International Airport.

Canjet said the plane had been due to depart Montego Bay for Cuba with 174 passengers and eight crew when the jetliner was hijacked.

But local officials gave the number of passengers released as 157. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.

Two crew members apparently locked themselves in the cockpit after the intruder managed to pass security and sneak into the plane shortly before midnight local time during a layover.
