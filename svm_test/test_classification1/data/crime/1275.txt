Tarique files petition for quashing bribery case
Tarique Rahman, elder son of former premier Khaleda Zia, yesterday filed a petition with the High Court (HC) for quashing the proceedings against him in the case of Tk 21-crore bribery following the murder of Humayun Kabir Sabbir, a director of Bashundhara Group.

Meanwhile, Jamaat-e-Islami Secretary General Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed filed a petition with the HC for anticipatory bail in the Barapukuria coal mine corruption case.

Hearings of both the petitions are likely to be held today.

On October 4 last year, Abul Kashem, deputy assistant director of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), filed the bribery case with Ramna Police Station, accusing six people including former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar. The ACC on May 6 pressed charges against Tarique Rahman, Lutfozzaman Babar and six others in the case.

The ACC on February 26 filed a case against BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia and 15 others including Jamaat-e-Islami Amir Motiur Rahman Nizami and Secretary General Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed for corruption in awarding operations contract of Barapukuria coal mine to a Chinese firm.
