Rajuk director, BRTA official held for fraud
The Anti-Corruption Commission yesterday arrested Rajuk Director AKM Shafiqur Rahman from the city's Segunbagicha in a case of fraud.

According to the case statement, Shafiqur took around Tk 81.50 lakh from plaintiff Ferdous Kabir with assurance that he would be allotted a 10 katha plot in Rajuk's Purbachal New Town Project area.

The director (zone-2) of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) neither allotted the plot to Kabir nor returned the money. In March 2014, he agreed to return Tk 60 lakh but gave back only Tk 6 lakh.

Shafiqur also gave Kabir a cheque of Tk 4 lakh, but it was later proved that the account belongs to another person.

Kabir had filed the case with Gulshan Police Station in July last year.

ACC Secretary Abu Md Mustafa Kamal said they picked up Shafiqur on charges of misappropriating the money.

Meanwhile, another ACC team yesterday arrested Abu Ashraf Siddiqui, assistant director of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), from Ekuria of Keraniganj on the outskirts of the capital on charges of misappropriating money.

ACC sources said Ashraf in league with others forged documents on car imports and dodged import duties worth Tk 4.23 lakh in 2011 when he was serving in the BRTA's Cox's Bazar office.

Five cases were filed against the official in 2012 on charges of misappropriating money. The anti-graft watchdog yesterday showed him arrested in one of the cases.

Both the arrestees were kept in custody of Ramna police.
