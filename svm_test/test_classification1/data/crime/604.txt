Teenage boy drives SUV, hits rickshaws
A teenage boy lost control of his sports utility vehicle (SUV) and rammed into two rickshaws, leaving four people injured in the Dhaka's Gulshan area yesterday.

The boy, Fareez Rahman, was filming himself on his mobile phone while driving the car, one of his friends told The Daily Star, seeking anonymity.

He also took selfies while driving, and sent those to his friends through photo-messaging app Snapchat.

Ferdous Ahmed Biswas, sub-inspector of Gulshan Police Station, said the incident took place on Road-74 in Gulshan around 3:45pm yesterday.

Asked, Rafiqul Islam, assistant commissioner (Gulshan zone) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, said one of the injured, Mohammad Rafique, 27, was admitted to the United Hospital in a critical condition.

Ferdous said another injured, Abdul Hakim, 32, was under treatment at the hospital, while the other two left the hospital after receiving first aid.

Fareez, a nephew of former Awami League (AL) lawmaker Dr HBM Iqbal, and his vehicle were taken to Gulshan Police Station, the AC said.

The driver of the SUV was driving recklessly before it hit the rickshaws, witnesses said.

No case was filed as of filing of this report at 1:30am today.
