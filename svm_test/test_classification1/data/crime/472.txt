Cyber crime and Bangladesh




"Though we use the term 'cyber crime' quite frequently, we barely know the definition of it," says Quazi MH Supan, Asst. Professor at the Department of Law in the University of Dhaka. And according to him it's because of the ever changing nature of the modern technologies. Due to cyber crimes surfing in the internet is harmful nowadays! In our country cyber crimes probably started with spam mails and Trojan attacks, but it now extended to debit/credit card theft, cell phone threats and frauds. On Sept. 5, 2008, RAB discovered that their website had been hacked! But RAB was successful in catching the hackers which proved that Bangladesh was not far behind in catching cyber criminals. Cell phone threats are also very harmful but the victims keep quiet as it would result in their embarrassment. We should take precautions against cyber crime. Please don't download free content from the internet as it carries within harmful software. We should not use cybercafés as most of their computers can record one's email address and basically everything that is typed! Take precautions.
