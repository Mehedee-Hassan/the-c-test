Rigging, forgery in 72 seats




The BNP has complained that there were irregularities, ballot rigging and forgery in 220 poll centres in 72 constituencies across the country during the just concluded ninth parliamentary election.

With early unofficial results going in favour of the Awami League-led grand alliance, BNP filed the complaints with the Election Commission last night.

BNP Office Secretary Rizvi Ahmed at a press briefing at the chairperson's Gulshan office claimed poll atmosphere was not as free and peaceful as they had expected.

Asked if the BNP and its alliance were rejecting the poll results on grounds of irregularities and rigging, he said they would give their reaction later today.

Earlier in the afternoon yesterday, BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia at a news conference at Ideal School and College alleged there was mismanagement in voting process. Casting votes in the city's vote centres was going at a slow pace, she added.

She also alleged that BNP workers and supporters were being harassed in different parts of the country and that some were even arrested on charge of attempting to buy votes.

By the late hours yesterday, the entire BNP camp suddenly became silent with a sense of a colossal defeat in the offing. Since then, no official words came from the party office.
