A Dhaka Court on Wednesday fixed March 27 for submitting the investigation report on the case filed in connection with the killing of writer and blogger Avijit Roy.

Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Khorshed Alam fixed the date in the morning as the investigation officer failed to submit the report today.

Avijit Roy, son of former Dhaka University's Physics professor Ajoy Roy and founder of blog Mukta-Mona, was killed and his wife Rafida Afrin Banya injured as at least two attackers stabbed them near TSC on the university campus on February 26, 2015.
