Two ex-GB officials jailed for embezzling Tk 1.25 lakh
A Barisal court on Sunday sentenced two suspended officials of Grameen Bank (GB) to 10-year imprisonment each in a case filed over misappropriating Tk 1.25 lakh.

The convicts are former manager Delwar Hossain and former officer Shah Alam of Grameen Bank Rayepasha-Karapur branch.

The court also fined the duo Tk 5 lakh each, in default, to suffer six more months in prison.

According to the prosecution, the convicts collected Tk 4.95 lakh as loan installments from three clients between Feb 10, 2009 and July 7, 2011.

But they deposited Tk 3.70 lakh, misappropriating the rest Tk 1.25 lakh, it said.

After receiving allegations from the clients, the GB authorities suspended the officials.

Later on October 3, 2012, Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed the case against the officials.

Md Nazimuddin, deputy director of ACC, submitted charge sheet against the duo on Oct 14, 2014.
