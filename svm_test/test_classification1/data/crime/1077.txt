Burglary at DBBL ATM booth in Kushtia
Masked robbers looted Tk 3.18 lakh by breaking an ATM booth of Dutch Bangla Bank Limited (DBBL) at Panchrastar More intersection in the town early Tuesday.

The gang also vandalised eleven CCTV (close circuit television) cameras installed for five ATM machines inside the first track centre of the bank.

Police quoted two night guards of the bank as saying that a gang of 7/8 armed robbers entered the first track centre around 3:00am and took the two guards hostage at gunpoint.

They later vandalised the CCTV cameras of the centre, looted the money by breaking one of the five ATM machines and fled the scene.

Nazrul Islam, manager of the bank's Kushtia branch, said they have already handed over the CCTV footages to the police.

Robiul Islam, officer-in-charge (investigation) of Kushtia Model Police Station, said they have detained the two night guards for quizzing and will resume their investigation after watching the CCTV footages.
