Man to die for killing Barisal University girl
A Barisal court today handed down death penalty to a man convicted of killing a first year Barisal University student back in 2013.

Condemned Russel Mia was the only man charged for the murder of 18-year-old girl Saoda Akhtar Mollik, who was stabbed to death on September 5, 2013.

Barisal Sessions Judges Court Judge Md Anwarul Haque passed the order after concluding hearing around 11:30am, reports our Barisal correspondent quoting Public Prosecutor Md Giasuddin Kabul.

Russel, a second year management student of Barisal University, was involved in an affair with Saoda, a first year student of accounting of the same university, for at least a year.

Saoda's parents rebuked her severely after they learned that Russel had proposed to her - an incident that caused their relationship to turn sour, prosecutor Giasuddin said quoting witnesses.

The girl tried to avoid Russel for a month, but the boy did not give up. He became infuriated and stabbed the girl with a knife inside campus premises. She died in the intensive care unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital.

The victim's mother Shahida Begum filed a case with Barisal Kotwali Police Station accusing Russel and two or three anonymous others stating that the boy was stalking her daughter.

University authorities expelled Russel after the incident.
