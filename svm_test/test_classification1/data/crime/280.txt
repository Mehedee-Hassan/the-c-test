Five Afghans kidnapped
Five Afghans linked to international groups working in Afghanistan have been kidnapped, officials said yesterday in the latest in a slew of abductions blamed on Taliban rebels or criminals.

Two workers with the Danish Committee for Aid to Afghan Refugees (DACAAR) were abducted on Sunday in the province of Logar about 50 kilometres (30 miles) south of Kabul, their organisation told AFP here.

The two men had wrapped up a water supply project and were heading home when they went missing, said director Arif Qaraeen.

Later Sunday one of their superiors was called by a man who said, "We have taken your people and you have to pay us some money," Qaraeen said.

"We have called the police, the intelligence, the relevant people, the kidnappers, the elders of the community to try to find a solution," he told AFP.

Logar police said the men had "disappeared." "We are searching for them," provincial police chief Ghulam Mustafa said.

A Bangladeshi national working with a microfinance development project was kidnapped in the same area on September 15 by men who demanded ransom through a video clip sent to a local television station.
