Pakistan suspects criminals behind US kidnapping
Pakistani police and intelligence agents were scrambling Monday to piece together information about a hitherto unheard of insurgent group that has claimed the kidnapping of an American UN official.

"This appears to be a criminal gang... kidnapping for ransom," a senior police investigator told AFP on condition of anonymity.

"We did not hear about it before and are gathering information about its origin," he added.

Another security official confirmed the same line of investigation.
