Four people were arrested on Friday night in the district's Sreenagar upazila for alleged involvement in hijacking a fish-laden van and killing an employee of a fish-trading agency early Thursday at the capital's Mohakhali.

The four are Badal, 30, of Barisal, Badsha, 30, of Jhalakathi, Kamal Hossain, 40, of Munshiganj, and Manik Miah, 22, of Kushtia. While making the arrests, police recovered a motorcycle and Tk 50,000 from their possession.

Sheikh Waziar Rahman, officer-in-charge of Hasara highway police outpost, said the arrestees had admitted their involvement in the hijack and the murder.

Yusuf, the driver, and Hafiz, an employee of Dui Bandhu Fish Enterprise, were thrown off the van. Later, Hafiz died at Dhaka Medical College Hospital.
