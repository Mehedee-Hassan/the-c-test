‘Classmates kill’ Natore madrasa student for ransom
A madrasa student was killed after abduction allegedly by his three classmates for ransom in Natore district town.

Rapid Action Battalion members recovered the body of Tanvir Alam, 11, a student of Hefzakhana Ashraful Ulum Hafezia Madrasa in Alaipur area, from a septic tank in the town this morning.

The drive came after the victim’s father, Saiful Islam, made a complaint with Rab, reports our Natore correspondent.

Raiding the madrasa early today, Rab picked up Tanvir’s three classmates -- Husaid Hossain, 15, Bayzid Hasan, 14, and Mohammad Naeem, 15.

The arrestees admitted their involvement in the incident, said the elite force.

Acting on their information, Rab men later recovered Tanvir’s body.

The Rab team also seized a razor and a rope allegedly used in the killing.

Lt Col Mahbubul Alam, commanding officer (CO) of Rab-5, said Tanvir was missing from August 25.

Later on August 28, Saiful Islam informed Rab that some unidentified criminals abducted his son and demanded Tk 5 lakh in ransom.

The official said since then the elite force members were trying to rescue Tanvir.

Lt Col Mahbubul said the trio allegedly got inspired by an Indian television serial to do the crime.

Immediately after the abduction, the assailants tied the hands and legs of Tanvir with a rope and then hacked on his throat with razor to death, he added.

After the murder, the trio called Tanvir’s family on mobile phone and demanded Tk 5 lakh in ransom, the official said.

"I demand exemplary punishment to the killers," Saiful, a resident of the town, added.
