A press release of the police identified three other Bangladeshis as Maksed alias Maksud, Rezaul Karim alias Shaheen, and Refaz Ahmed alias Rony – all employees of City Bank.

The German citizen entered Bangladesh using a false name, said the press release. “The three Bangladeshis are directly involved with the ATM fraud.”

A Polish passport and a German national identity card was seized from the foreign national.

It was the first of its kind ATM scam. Fraudsters skimmed off ATM cards of the clients and withdrew the money from various booths of three banks.

Police said they had four foreigners under the scanner and they were sure that one of them was a fraudster involved directly. They were identified from the close circuit cameras in the booths.

The central bank was prompted to order EBL to reimburse all the affected clients. Also, it told all banks to install anti-skimming devices and take necessary steps to avoid such incident in the future.
