The suspect, M Abdullah-Al-Baki alias Abdullah-Hel-Baki, 102, was arrested nine days after the International Crimes Tribunal issued arrest warrant against him.

M Abdullah-Al-Baki was arrested as per a warrant of arrest issued against three Satkhira war crimes suspects on March 8, prosecutor Rezia Sultana Chamon told New Age.
