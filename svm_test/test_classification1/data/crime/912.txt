Miscreants on Monday night killed a ‘pir’, spiritual leader, and his female assistant at his shrine in a remote village of Bochaganj in the country’s northern Dinajpur district, police said.

Dinajpur police said Farhad Chowdhury, aged around 60, and his 18-year-old assistant Rupali were found murdered at a tin-shed house located at Dowlagram of the upazila about 9:00pm where the ‘pir’ used preach to his followers.

‘Two people were killed inside their house,’ said Ragnpur range police deputy inspector general Khandaker Golam Faruk without detailing the motive of the killings.

He said the man used to go to the house where the teenage girl used to stay.

Bobachaganj police officer-in-charge Arju Mohammad Sajjad Hossain rushed to the spot after police were informed by local people about 10:00pm.
