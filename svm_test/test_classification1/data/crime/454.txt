Court to decide tomorrow on summoning Khaleda in loan default case
A Dhaka court will decide tomorrow whether BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia and three members of her family have to submit their written statements in person before it on April 12 in loan default case.

The three family members are Arafat Rahman Koko's wife Sharmila Rahman Sithi and her daughters Zafia Rahman and Zahia Rahman.

Judge Roksana Begum Happy of Artha Rin Adalat-1 today fixed the date after hearing a petition submitted by the state-owned Sonali Bank for issuing summons upon them to appear before it in connection with the case.

Earlier in the day, the same court had summoned the BNP chief and three others of her family to appear before it on April 12 to submit their written statements in connection with the case, court sources said.

On March 18, the same court granted a Sonali Bank’s petition to include the four as defendants in the case on behalf of Koko, who died on January 24.

The court also fixed April 12 as the next date of hearing in the case.

Koko was made a defendant in the case filed for realising Tk 45.59 crore.

On October 2 in 2012, Sonali Bank Ltd filed a money suit against 10 directors of Dandy Dyeing Ltd, including BNP Senior Vice Chairman Tarique Rahman and Koko, for defaulting on a loan amounting to Tk 45.59 crore.

The company had borrowed Tk 12.16 crore from the bank's principal office in Dhaka on October 16, 2001, the case statement said.

As the company failed to pay it off, the principal loan plus interest accumulated over the last 11 years totalling to an amount of Tk 45.59 crore.

The other accused in the case include Giasuddin Al-Mamun and his wife Shahina Yasmine, Sayeed Iskander’s wife Nasrin Iskander, Shams Iskander, Shafin Iskander, Sumaiya Iskander, Mozaffar Ahmed and Kazi Galib Abdus Sattar.

Nazrul Islam, senior executive officer of the bank's principal office, filed the case with Artha Rin Adalat-1.
