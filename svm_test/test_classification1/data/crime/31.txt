One caught trying to steal money at Sonali Bank
A person was caught red-handed at Sonali Bank branch on the Dhaka University campus yesterday morning when he tried to steal money from the cash box.

Senior Principal Officer of the branch Rahmat Ara said cashier Suprio Ranjan Chakma caught Mohammad Yunus when he was trying to steal money from the cash box.

Yunus told the bank authorities that he came from Khulna and his accomplice managed to escape. Yunus was later handed over to the police.

Rahmat Ara said that Prof Amulia Chandra Mandal of Mathematics department lost Tk one lakh on April 21 from the branch and she also lost her purse and a mobile set on April 13 from the bank premises.

“We informed the higher authorities and they told us to restrict the entrance to the office room, but it is really tough to enforce restriction as we have to deal with university students and they want to meet the officers for their problems several times,” she added.
