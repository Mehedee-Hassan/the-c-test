Banker held for money embezzlement
Agrani Bank authorities have handed over one of its officials to police on charge of misappropriating Tk 11.53 crore from the bank.

Abdul Malek Mandal, who served as the manager of the state-owned bank's Hatkhola Branch in capital's Sutrapur, was handed to Sutrapur police around 11:00pm on Thursday, police said.

Mohammad Nazrul Islam, officer-in-charge (OC) of Sutrapur Police Station, said they arrested the accused.

Earlier on the day, the bank authorities suspended him and two others -- Parimal Kumar Biswas and Rakibul Alam Sarkar -- for allegedly embezzling the said amount through sanctioning loans violating the rules.

Faridul Islam, assistant general manager of the branch, said Malek in league with the two others sanctioned loans to 11 persons providing wrong information and fake address.

In an audit, the bank authorities found that the loans were beyond the approved credit limit, added Faridul, who filed the case and handed over Malek to police.

Police are trying to arrest the two other accused.
