China passes law to prevent embezzling of state assets
Chinese legislators have passed a law aiming to prevent state-owned assets from being sold too cheaply or embezzled by officials, state media reported.

The law, passed late Tuesday, bans managers of state companies or their relatives from using their position to secure excessively large shares of the enterprises for themselves, the Xinhua news agency said.

"The law was made to close legal loopholes and better protect state-owned assets," said legislator An Jian, according to the report.

He said some state-owned assets were embezzled after being converted into cheap stocks, sold at low prices or even obtained free.

"Such conducts caused the loss of state-owned assets and triggered strong public complaint and concern," An said.
