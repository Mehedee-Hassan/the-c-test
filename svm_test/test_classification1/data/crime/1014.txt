Steps to bring eve-teasers to book in Chittagong




At last, steps have been taken to save schoolgirls in the port city from the menace of eve teasing.

Chittagong Metropolitan Police (CMP) yesterday launched a special programme to extend all-out support to the schoolgirls and wipe out the meance.

On the first day, the CMP arranged a rally on the premises of Dr Khastagir Girls' High School where Deputy Police Commissioner (North) Banaj Kumar Majumder was the chief guest.

In his speech, the police commissioner urged the students to inform the law enforcers through cellphones about any untoward incidents if they face on the way to school or while returning home.

He assured the schoolgirls of all-out support without disclosing their identity.

The police commissioner said if any schoolgirl faces a difficult situation, she can take help from the law enforcers by sending SMS message to senior CMP officials like deputy commissioner (DC), assistant commissioner (AC) of the respective zone or the officer-in-charge (OC) of the respective police station.

He said they will contact with the victim after getting the message and take necessary steps.

Two students of the school also spoke at the rally where headmistress Hasmat Jahan, Assistant Commissioner (AC) of Kotwali zone Babul Akhter, Officer-in-Charge (OC) of Kotwali Police Station Shah Alam and teachers of the school were present.

Later the deputy police commissioner gave cellphone numbers of the senior police officials of Kotwali zone to the headmistress of the school.

The phone numbers were later displayed on the blackboards in each class from where the students collected those.

Depraved boys manage to gather cellphone numbers of schoolgirls from the phone centers and in other ways and start teasing or disturbing them.

A student said most of the girls do not share this problem with their guardians or teachers fearing that they might be blamed.
