Pirates hijack Bangladeshi ship in the Arabian sea
Pirates have hijacked a Bangladesh-flagged ship in the Arabian Sea off the coast of India, shipping officials in Dhaka said yesterday.

"The pirates embarked on board after chasing MV Jahan Moni in the Arabian Sea on Sunday," a senior official at the Bangladesh Shipping Department (BSD) said.

"We have sought help from anti-piracy teams in Dubai and Singapore, and Indian coast guards," Rear Admiral Bazlur Rahman, head of the shipping department told Reuters, without giving further details.

The BSD, an arm of the ministry of shipping, monitors and regulates external shipping and ferry services.

Another BSD official said: "The ship has been captured by the pirates."

The 16-crew ship owned by a Bangladeshi shipping firm was heading towards Europe with merchandise from Singapore, the BSD said. No other details about the ship were available immediately.

Somali pirates are making tens of millions of dollars in ransoms from seizing ships in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden , though Sunday's hijack happened around 3,000 km (1,864 miles) east of Somalia.
