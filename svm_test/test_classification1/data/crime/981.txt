ACC arrests Standard Bank officer for embezzling Tk 1cr
Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) arrested a former branch manager of Standard Bank in connection with an embezzlement case in Sylhet on Tuesday and filed a case against the managing director of Midland Bank for illegally amassing wealth in the capital yesterday.

Our Sylhet correspondent report: a team of ACC arrested Hossian Ahmed, former Bishwanath branch manager of Standard Bank, in Pathantula of Sylhet Tuesday afternoon in a cased filed for embezzling Tk 1.15 crore from the bank's clients and handed him over to Bishwanath police, said sources at the ACC's Sylhet regional office.

He used to embezzle the clients' money while he was posted at the branch between January 2014 and May 2015, added the sources.

On July 9 of last year, ADP Parvez, vice president of the bank, filed a case with the police station accusing Hossain of misappropriating Tk 16.5lac.

Later, the case was transferred to the ACC which, after an investigation, found that he embezzled a total of Tk 1.15 crore from the clients, said Dr Abul Hasan, deputy director of the ACC Sylhet office.

Our staff correspondent reports: the ACC yesterday filed a case with Gulshan Police Station in the capital, accusing Ahsan-uz-Zaman, the managing director and chief executive officer of Midland Bank, of "amassing Tk 11,242,542 illegally and providing false information" in his wealth statement submitted to the commission.

According to the ACC, there are 25 joint accounts of Zaman, his wife and mother with the bank, and he operates all the accounts. The discrepancy was also found between the amount of money in the accounts and income tax he paid.

He, however, could not be reached to comment on the issue despite several attempts from The Daily Star.
