Protesting Assault On Son: Elderly freedom fighter beaten up
Eighty-eight-year-old freedom fighter was severely beaten up by some of his villagers in Ishwarganj upazila as he protested assault on his son over a trivial matter on Saturday.

The victim, Imam Uddin, of Ujanchar village in the upazila, is undergoing treatment at the local upazila health complex.

Quoting locals and the victim's family, Badrul Alam Khan, officer-in-charge of Ishwarganj Police Station, said Imam's son Jalal Uddin went to a local bazar to have a cup of tea on Saturday noon when arbitration on a land dispute was going on there.

At one stage, people involved in the arbitration were locked in an altercation. When Jalal made a comment about the altercation, an angry Nurul Islam, son of Ruhul Amin, also got into an altercation with Jalal over his comment.

Nurul then beat up Jalal and forced him to leave the place. Hearing the incident, Imam protested it and asked Nurul why his son was beaten up.

Being angry, Ruhul, his son Nurul and brother Robiqul Islam along with some others went to Imam's house and beat him up with sticks before the family members, injuring him seriously.

Talking to this correspondent, Imam alleged that the attackers beat him up over a trifling matter. "I want justice for the attack."

Imam filed a case with Ishwarganj Police Station, accusing five people, including Ruhul, Nurul and Robiqul, on Sunday night, said OC Badrul.

No one was arrested yet in this connection.

Abdus Sattar, commander of Ishwarganj upazila Muktijoddha unit, also visited Imam at the hospital.

"Attack on a freedom fighter is a heinous crime and the culprits must be brought to book immediately," the commander demanded.
