Between a Thief and a Crooked Wholesaler




Viewers can expect to have their conscience shaken by the single-episode TV play, titled “Amra Ekti Bhorer Opekkhae Achi”. Written and directed by Zahirul Haq Bappy and Abdullah Rana respectively, the play is going to be aired on Pahela Boishakh on Desh TV.

The plot zooms in on a petty thief and a wholesaler who sells adulterated rice. Mafizur, the thief, wants his son Suman to grow up to be an honest man. He hides his real profession from his son. Solaiman, the crooked wholesaler, is often embarrassed by his son, Emran, who steals money from his father's cash box, and gives away money to the needy. Emran hopes that his actions would compensate for his father's corrupt nature. However, Solaiman wants his son to be a corrupt trader like himself.

The plot thickens when Mofizur gets caught while stealing and the mob, led by Solaiman, decides to humiliate him in front of his son.
