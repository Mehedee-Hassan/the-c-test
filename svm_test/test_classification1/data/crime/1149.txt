Gaibandha MP, his men sued for vandalism, looting house
A case has been filed against ruling party lawmaker Manzurul Islam Liton, who allegedly shot a 10-year-old boy recently, and nine “of his men” on charges of vandalising a house and looting its corrugated tin sheet roofs and furniture in a Gaibandha village.

Owner of the house, Hafizur Mandal, who is a driver of a locally-made three-wheeler, lodged the lawsuit with Sundarganj Police Station on Tuesday, police said yesterday.

Around 8:00am on October 2, the ten accused ransacked the house in Uttar Shabazpur of Sundarganj upazila and left the scene taking the tin sheet roofs and furniture, worth over Tk 3 lakh, with them, Hafizur told The Daily Star.

He said he did not file the case earlier in fear of fresh attack by Liton, Awami League lawmaker from Gaibandha-1, and his men.

Contacted, Israil Hossain, officer-in-charge of Sundarganj Police Station, said they were investigating the matter and adequate steps would be taken against the culprits, if necessary.

Abdul Hye Milton, upazila nirbahi officer of Sundarganj, said on information police had raided a cold storage of Liton in Railway Station area of Bamondanga union and recovered the missing items from there. Later, they handed over those to Hafizur.

Meanwhile, Sundarganj Awami League on Wednesday night held an emergency meeting where it discussed the current political situation in the upazila in face of the shooting of a boy allegedly by the unit's president Liton, said sources.

Around 6:00am on October 2, Sourav Mia, a class IV student, was shot in the legs in Gopalcharan village allegedly by the lawmaker for no reason. Saju Mia, the victim's father, filed a case with Sundarganj police the next day.

Sourav is being treated at Rangpur Medical College Hospital. Liton is absconding.
