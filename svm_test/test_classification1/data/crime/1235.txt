Driver shot dead, microbus hijacked
Hijackers shot dead a driver and stabbed a passenger of a microbus and took it away in the city's Lalmatia yesterday.

The injured passenger, Ivan Ahmed, 25, is taking treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital.

He introduced himself as a nephew of Shipping Minister Shahjahan Khan and said the owner of the microbus is Azizur Rahman Shibu Khan, a cousin of the minister.

He said Azizur Rahman's family was shifting from Uttara to Lalmatia Sunday night.

He and driver Dulal Shikder, 24, were going to Lalmatia taking furniture in the microbus around 1:00am when a car carrying five to six people blocked their way, Ivan said.

He added, “They hacked my hand with a machete and fired a bullet in the driver's back and took away the microbus.”
