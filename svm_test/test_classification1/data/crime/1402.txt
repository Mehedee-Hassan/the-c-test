Maldives orders public caning for sex assault
A Maldivian court has ordered a man to be caned 25 times in public and spend two years in jail for sexually assaulting a female Japanese teacher on the atoll nation, police said yesterday.

The sentence was handed down on Tuesday by a criminal court in the capital Male after the man confessed to the offence committed in November, police spokesman Ahmed Shiyam told AFP.

Crime is rare in the Maldives, an Indian Ocean nation of 330,000 Sunni Muslims. The honeymoon destination has its own form of Islamic Sharia law that prescribes public floggings for those found guilty of sex offences.
