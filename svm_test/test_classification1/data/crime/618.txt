Maya served legal notice
Relief and Disaster Management Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya today was served a notice over his legitimacy as lawmaker and minister.

The notice asked him to explain by 24 hours under what authority he is holding the offices after the apex court annulled his acquittal in a graft case.

Eunus Ali Akond, a Supreme Court lawyer, served the notice in “public interest” saying that Maya has been legally disqualified to serve as minister or lawmaker after the apex court’s verdict.

On June 14, Supreme Court cancelled a High Court verdict that acquitted minister and senior Awami League leader Maya in a graft case of 2007.

A special court on February 14, 2008, handed Maya to 13 years in prison and Tk 5 crore in fine for amassing illegal property. Authorities concerned were also directed to confiscate Maya’s property.

After Maya appealed against the verdict, the High Court, on February 14, 2008, acquitted him of the corruption charges. Not only this verdict was overruled, but the HC was also told to go for further hearing on Maya’s appeal.

Lawyer Eunus says Maya cannot hold the office of lawmaker and minister under Article 66 (2)(D) of the constitution of Bangladesh.

Citing the article Eunus told The Daily Star that a person who is convicted and sentenced for moral turpitude cannot contest the election and hold the office of parliament member or minister.

He said that he will file a writ petition with the High Court seeking necessary directives against Maya if he does not respond to the legal notice within 24 hours.
