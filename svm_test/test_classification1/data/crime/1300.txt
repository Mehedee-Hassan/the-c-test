Nazmul Huda, Sigma sued for bribery
The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) yesterday filed a bribery case against detained BNP leader and former communications minister Nazmul Huda and his wife Sigma Huda.

ACC Assistant Director Belal Hossain filed the case with Motijheel Police Station accusing the two of taking Tk 6 lakh bribe from a contractor of Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority.

After filing the case, Belal, also the investigation officer (IO) of the case, submitted a petition to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's, Court, Dhaka for showing both the accused arrested in the case.

Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Golam Rabbani granted the petition.

The case mentioned that Nazmul Huda demanded bribes from the owner of a bridge maintenance firm in exchange for a work order for the maintenance of the Jamuna Bridge. Huda was communications minister at that time.

As per his demand, the owner of the firm provided Huda Tk 6 lakh to the account of weekly Khoborer Antorale at the Amin court (Motijheel) branch of Agrani Bank in 20 cheques between September 30, 2004 and October 18, 2006, the case statement said. The firm also got the work order.

Sigma Huda, who used to run the weekly, drew the money from the bank, the complainant said.

The case was filed under sections 161 and 165 (A) of the Penal Code and section 5 (2) (misuse of power) of Corruption Prevention Act 1947.

Earlier, separate special courts set up at Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises acquitted Sigma Huda in two extortion cases and sentenced her to 3 years' imprisonment in a case on charges of aiding and abetting her husband in taking Tk 2.4 crore bribes from the proprietor of a construction firm.

On June 5, the HC granted three months' ad interim bail to Sigma Huda in the bribery case under emergency power rules (EPR).

The ACC has filed a provisional appeal with the Supreme Court against the HC order granting her bail. Hearing of the appeal will be held today.
