Gulshan attack mastermind Rajib ‘confesses’ to 3 murders
Jahangir Alam alias Rajib Gandhi, a top Neo JMB leader and the mastermind of the Gulshan terror attack, reportedly confessed to his part in the killing of three people before a court in Gaibandha on Monday.

Senior judicial magistrate Joynal Abedin recorded his statement when he told the court about his involvement in other criminal activities, including abduction, looting, polygamy, after joining the militant group.

Meanwhile, the court also placed him on a five-day remand when Saidur Rahman, inspector of Criminal Investigation Department, sought five-day remand to get more information about militant attacks.

A Counter Terorism and Transnational Crime team in a drive arrested Rajib in Elenga bus stand area of Tangail on January 13.

Twenty hostages, including 17 foreign nationals, were killed by extremists at Holey Artisan Bakery in Gulshan area of the capital on July 1 last year.

The following day, five attackers and one suspected associate of the attackers were killed during a commando operation inside the cafe, ending the hostage crisis.
