A court in Dhaka today sent Amar Desh acting editor Mahmudur Rahman to jail in a case filed in connection with a plot to 'abduct and kill' Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy.

Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Maruf Hossain passed the order when police produced him before the court on completion of his five-day remand.
