UK gives equipment to detect forged travel documents
British High Commission in Dhaka has provided Bangladesh's Special Branch Immigration with state-of-the-art forgery detection equipment to detect fraudulent travel documentation.

It has been installed in the newly established 'Document Examination Centre' of Special Branch Headquarters. Twenty Special Branch officers will receive training in using the equipment, said a press release.

The initiative -- worth over 80,000 pound sterling -- is designed to increase the country's capacity to detect the use of fraudulent travel documentation for people entering and leaving Bangladesh.

British High Commissioner Stephen Evans said, "I am delighted that the UK is able to support to the government of Bangladesh in promoting excellence and expertise in high-tech forgery detection and protecting borders."

"It is an example of the continuing co-operation between our countries in fighting immigration crime and we will seek opportunities to increase our practical support," he added.
