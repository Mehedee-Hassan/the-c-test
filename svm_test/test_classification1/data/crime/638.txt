Egypt's government resigns amid corruption probe
Egypt's Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb and his Cabinet resigned Saturday amid a corruption investigation that led to the arrest of the agriculture minister last week.

The office of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said that he had accepted the resignation but that the ministers would continue to serve until a new body is appointed.

El-Sissi tasked Petroleum Minister Sherif Ismail with forming a new Cabinet within a week, two officials from the president's office said.

Prior to handing in his resignation, Mehleb gave a report detailing the performance of the government, which both officials said el-Sissi found "unsatisfying."

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to brief reporters.

Agriculture Minister Salah el-Din Helal was detained Monday after tendering his resignation amid an investigation into allegations that he and others received over $1 million in bribes.

The Egyptian government has long been plagued by corruption allegations. El-Sissi routinely emphasizes that he is fighting corruption.

Mehleb walked out of a press conference in Tunisia earlier this week after being asked about the corruption allegations.
