Glaucoma — the creeping thief of sight




Glaucoma is an eye disease that damages the nerve involved in vision (called optic nerve) and progresses from visual disturbance to permanent loss of vision if left untreated. It is called the silent thief of sight and the person with glaucoma is usually unaware of it until serious loss of vision has occurred. It is often, but not always, associated with increased pressure of the fluid in the eye (aqueous humour). However, it is completely treatable if detected early.

A person developing the condition may experience symptoms like gradual loss of peripheral vision, usually in both eyes, tunnel vision in the advanced stages or with acute signs and symptoms include: Severe eye pain, nausea and vomiting, sudden onset of visual disturbance, often in low light, blurred vision, halos around lights, reddening of the eye.

People with certain conditions increase the risk of developing Glaucoma. They include elevated internal eye pressure (intraocular pressure), age more than 60, African-Americans, family history of glaucoma, nearsightedness, prolonged corticosteroid use, Diabetes and other eye conditions like severe eye injuries, closing the drainage angle, eye tumours and eye inflammations.

Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness. The most common type of glaucoma, primary open-angle glaucoma, has no noticeable signs or symptoms except gradual vision loss. Early diagnosis and treatment can minimise or prevent optic nerve damage and limit glaucoma-related vision loss.
