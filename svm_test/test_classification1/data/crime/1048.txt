Eve teasing in Khulna
During the summer vacation of my college, I had to take my son to his school for some days and during his school hours I used to wait a park named 'Bandhan' situated just beside the Khulna passport office and near the 'Morning Bell School' where my son is enrolled. When I used to wait in that park, I witnessed what eve teasing is and how many kinds it has.

There is a school named 'Khulna Collegiate School' near the park and during starting of the school when girl students go to school, some boys aged between 15 and 22 start throwing bad comments and often show various vulgar body languages. The stalkers do not seem to be school or college goers.

One day I became stunned to see that they teased a girl who was escorted probably by her mother. One of the boys tried to stop others saying that her mother was with her. But others continued their bad comments, whistling and obscene gestures. Often I used to see one or two boys rushing out of the park and following the girls up to school gate.

Every day when the school starts, a group of ten/twelve youths arrive in the park and do the same thing. The law enforcers can go to the park in plain dress on any school day and observe their activities. The boys usually gather around 9.30 and stay up to 11 or 11.30am.

My wife was with me for a day or two and observed and inspired me to write something on it. We are really helpless. When the administration is in deep sleep, what can we do?
