Goa opens smuggling museum




The long beaches and rocky inlets of western India have been a haven for contraband for centuries, with smugglers sneaking their goods into the country via the Arabian Sea.

In the past, gold was the commodity of choice along with opium. Illegal narcotics have dominated in recent years, after Goa became a key stopping-off point on the drug-fuelled hippie trail in the 1960s and 1970s.

Now a new museum has opened to tell the story of India's smuggling history, displaying the unusual items uncovered by keen-eyed customs officials and the elaborate lengths smugglers went to in an effort to conceal their activities.

The Indian Customs and Central Excise Museum, created at a reported cost of about 600,000 dollars, is housed in a heritage building on the banks of the river Mandovi in the Goa state capital Panaji.

The building, painted in indigo blue after the dye traded in Portuguese colonial times, is thought to have been built in 1600 and served as the headquarters for customs operations from 1834 to the turn of the 21st century.

Lillian Fernandes, the officer in charge of the museum, said collecting the exhibits has been a labour of love, with workers scanning through huge lists of seized goods from across India and then battling through red tape.
