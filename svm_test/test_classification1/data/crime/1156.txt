Worker's death sparks protests, vandalism
Several hundred garment workers blocked the Dhaka-Mymensingh Highway at Borobari of Gazipur for three hours protesting the death of a coworker in a road accident, yesterday morning.

Vehicular movement came to a halt following the blockade, causing a long tailback on both sides of the thoroughfare in Gazipur and Uttara.

The deceased worker identified as Sheuli Akhter, 22, was a sewing operator of Best Shirt Ltd and lived with her parents at Borobari.

Coworkers said Sheuli died on the spot as a Dhaka-bound bus ran over her around 7:50am while she was crossing the highway with some of her colleagues on their way to work

As the news spread, agitating factory workers and locals barricaded the highway and staged angry demonstrations, demanding immediate arrest of the bus driver and construction of a footbridge and speed breakers.

Angry workers also vandalised around 20 vehicles during the demonstration that continued till 10:45am compelling police to charge baton, said police.

Later, the police made repeated assurances for the workers' demands to be met, after which the situation was brought under control, said SM Kamruzzaman, officer-in-charge of Joydevpur Police Station

The bus driver fled after the incident and nobody has been detained in this connection, he added.
