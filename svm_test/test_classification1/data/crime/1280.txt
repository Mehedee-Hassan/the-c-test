Traders foil Rab drive over 'bribery'
Several hundred cloth traders foiled a Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) and customs drive to seize illegal cloths in the capital's Kotwali yesterday.

The traders of Bikrampur Garden City Market alleged that the Rab personnel demanded bribe after seizing some cloths in the drive that started around 10:00am, sparking protests among them.

As negotiations between the traders and the Rab over releasing the seized cloths failed, the traders staged demonstration for over two hours closing their shops in the evening.

Amid the demonstration, around 20 Rab personnel left the scene around 7:00pm and took shelter at nearby Kotwali Police Station.

Kotwali police charged batons and dispersed the agitating traders around 9:00pm.

Contacted, ASP of Rab-10 Enamul Kabir confirmed the incident of market raid but denied the allegation of bribery. He said they will investigate the incident today.
