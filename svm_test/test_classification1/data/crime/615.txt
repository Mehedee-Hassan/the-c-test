Niko graft: Khaleda’s trial to continue
The High Court today rejected a petition filed by BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia challenging the legality of Niko graft case, clearing the way for her trial in the 2007 case.

The court directed Khaleda to surrender before a lower court by two months in connection with the case after getting the full text of the verdict.

The court also asked the lower court to consider granting bail to Khaleda Zia after she surrenders.

The HC Bench of Justice MD Nuruzzaman and Justice Zafar Ahmed came up with the verdict after conclusion of hearing on Khaleda’s petition against the case filed by Anti-Corruption Commission.

The ACC filed the Niko graft case with Tejgaon Police Station on December 9, 2007.

It accused Khaleda and several others of abusing power while she was the prime minister to award a gas exploration and extraction deal to the Canadian company.

Former law minister Moudud Ahmed, former state minister for energy AKM Mosharraf Hossain, former acting energy secretary Khandaker Shahidul Islam and Kashem Sharif, vice-president (South Asia) of Niko Resources Bangladesh Ltd, were also sued in the case.
