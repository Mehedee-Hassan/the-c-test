Nine Chinese oil workers kidnapped in Sudan
Nine Chinese oil workers have been kidnapped near Sudan's disputed central oil district of Abyei, the Chinese embassy said yesterday, with a Sudanese driver also feared missing.

"Nine Chinese oil workers, they are kidnapped," an embassy spokesman told AFP, asking not to be named. "We're still looking into the issue. We're taking the necessary steps."

He said the kidnapping happened on Saturday and that the embassy was in crisis talks following the incident.

"We're now in a meeting with our ambassador," he said. "We have contacts with the Sudanese authorities to identify and localise the kidnappers."
