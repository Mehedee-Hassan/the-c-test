It’s well-planned murder: Raudha’s father
Mohamed Athif, father of Rajshahi Islami Bank Medical College second-year student Raudha Athif, on Sunday once again claimed that his daughter was ‘a victim of a well-planned murder’.

Addressing a press conference at Rajshahi Press Club on the eve of exhumation of the body for a fresh autopsy, he claimed, ‘When I left the mortuary I had enough preliminary evidences to point that my daughter’s death was a homicidal case. All our 12-member team saw the marks on her body.’

‘Apart from this, there were signs of manual strangulation with hand on her neck. The bruising caused by strangulation is clearly visible on her neck,’ he said, adding, ‘we all saw the exact mark, its colour and appearance’.

He said that he, along with officials, had gone to Raudha’s hostel, inspected her room and met some of her college mates, including three girls and one boy from Maldives who are studying there.

Athif claimed that they found signs of struggle in her room as some of the items there appeared to be damaged or broken, including the mirror of the wardrobe near the point of hanging.

He said that some students told him that they had entered the room by breaking the door. ‘But I have seen that door and its locks were not damaged and all the windows of her room were secured with iron grills.’

He also said there was no dribbling of saliva on Raudha’s face and the appearance of ligature mark did not match with an imprint that could be caused by a shawl.

‘Why there is not a single damage to the ceiling fan when a girl of 55kg was hanged from it,’ Athif questioned.

He appealed to her college authorities, investigation agencies and journalists to work towards bringing those behind her death to book.

On March 29, the police recovered the body of Raudha from the female hostel.
