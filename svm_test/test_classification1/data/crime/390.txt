The suspected fraudsters drew the amount from Vielatex Ltd's accounts with Uttara and Gulshan branches of HSBC Bank and Uttara branch of AB Bank in between November 11 last year and January 12.

They are Emon, 24, Robin, 26, Abul Kashem Dipu alias Rabu, 24, and Raihan Rashid.

Of them, Raihan was an employee of the factory and Robin a worker of a computer firm at Nilkhet in the capital.

A team of Detective Branch (DB) of police has also recovered Tk 1.5 lakh from them during the drive that began in late November.
