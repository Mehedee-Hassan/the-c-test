Tonu, a student of Comilla Victoria Government College and theatre activist, was found murdered in the Comilla Cantonment area on March 20. The killing sparked huge public outcry.

Following a court order, Tonu's body was exhumed and the three-member board conducted a second autopsy on March 30. The report is yet to be prepared.

After almost two months after the killing of the 19-year-old college student the CID on May 16 said Tonu was raped before she was murdered.

The latest findings expose the flaws in the inquest and first autopsy reports which did not find any evidence of rape.
