Vandalism on Dhaka-Ctg highway
DEATH of a Jamaat leader at the hands of unidentified assailants triggered unprecedented vandalism and arson by the activists of this party and its student wing, Shibir, in the Sitakunda area on Dhaka-Chittagong highway. Dozens of vehicles were smashed and the traffic came to a halt in miles-long tailback for over six hours on Wednesday.

We are aghast at such outrageous act of violence and condemn it in the strongest possible terms.

Why did the Jamaat-Shibir activists come down on unsuspecting road users destroying vehicles indiscriminately and disrupting traffic on a vital communication artery of the country? Were the passengers and owners of the vehicles they destroyed behind the death of their leader?

Such behaviour of the Jamaat-Shibir people defies all rationality. If anything, it only demonstrates their total disregard for the life and security of the general public.

This is also not for the first time that they perpetrated such vandalism; especially those who have had the misfortune of travelling along the Sitakunda section of the Dhaka-Chittagong highway know it too well.

They can demand arrest and punishment of those responsible for the death of their leader. But to go for such mind-boggling reaction is unpardonable.

Except severe public opprobrium, they can't hope to achieve anything by acts of violence. They must stop behaving hysterically and thereby cause untold sufferings to public life.
