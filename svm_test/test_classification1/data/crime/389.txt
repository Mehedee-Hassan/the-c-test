Land fraud syndicate takes Tk 12 lakh loan from bank
A land fraud syndicate allegedly took a loan of Tk 12 lakh from a commercial bank after submitting fake documents against 8.75 decimals of land at Paikpara in the city's Mirpur area.

However, the Mirpur Branch of Al Arafah Islami Bank on September 27 announced to auction the land after serving loan repayment notice to the recipients for several times.

As the genuine owner of the land AM Shamsul Alam came to know the matter, he filed separate cases with a Dhaka court and Mirpur Police Station against two alleged frauds Nasir Uddin and Kawser Rashid in this connection.

One of the cases filed is pending with the Joint District Judge's Court, Dhaka. The other case is now being investigated by an official of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

Owner of the land said Nasir Uddin, in guise of a buyer, collected photocopies of the land's all documents from him when he had taken an initiative to sell out the land in 2001.

Later, the frauds adopted unfair means and changed the name of the owner through an affidavit. They also attached his photograph with the affidavit and took the loan. Four officials of the bank, including a former manager, were involved in this process.

AM Shamsul Alam said all these happened while he was abroad. On his return, he came to know the matter and filed the cases.
