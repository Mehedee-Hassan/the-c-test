Two cattle thieves die in mob beating
Two cattle thieves were lynched by angry mob at Madhupur in Tangail in the early hours of yesterday.

The dead were identified as Mohammad Ainal Miah, 30, son of Khalilur Rahman Khoka of Bekerkona village and his younger brother Mohammad Ripon Miah, 25.

Police said a gang of cattle thieves entered Mohishmara village by a three-wheeler at around 3:30am in a bid to steal cattle.

Sensing their presence, the villagers surrounded the gang and caught two of the thieves and beat them mercilessly to death.

The rest of the thieves, however, managed to escape the scene with the three-wheeler, they said.

On information, Madhupur police rushed to the spot, recovered the bodies and sent them to Tangail General Hospital morgue for autopsy.

ANM Golam Mostofa, officer-in-charge (OC) of Madhupur Police Station, told The Daily Star that Ainal and Ripon were professional cattle thieves.

"Madhupur police had arrested them with four stolen cows on April 22 but they were released on bail recently," he added.
