Detectives arrested a suspected leader of banned extremist outfit Ansarullah Bangla Team in connection with the murders of blogger Niladri Chatterjee Niloy and publisher Faisal Arefin Dipan at the city on Friday night.



Police said the arrested is Khairul Islam alias Jamil alias Rifat alias Fahim alias Jisan. He is a member on core team of Ansarullah's intelligence wing, police added.



A team of the Detective Branch arrested the ABT member, said deputy commissioner (media) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police Masudur Rahman.



Details about the arrested will be disclosed at a press briefing at the DMP Media Centre later.



On May 20, the DMP announced a bounty for information leading to the arrest of six alleged ABT kingpins, including Shamim, who were reportedly involved in the murders of secular bloggers, writers and publishers in recent times.



Dipan, owner of Jagriti Publications and son of professor Abul Kashem Fazlul Huq of Dhaka University, was hacked to death in his office on the second floor of Aziz Super Market at Shahbagh in the capital on October 31, 2015.



On August 7, 2015, Niloy was hacked to death by unidentified assailants inside his fourth-floor flat at North Goran in the city.
