Special tribunal for Khaleda after Eid: Inu
Information Minister Hasanul Haq Inu today said a special tribunal will be formed after Eid-ul-Fitr for speedy disposal of cases against BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia for instigating arson attacks during the BNP-led alliance’s agitation since January.

“Khaleda recently led the arson attacks which killed more than 140 people... She is accused of mass killing. A tribunal will be formed after Eid to try Khaleda,” the minister made the comment while talking to reporters after inaugurating a new building of a school in Mirpur upazila of Kushtia this morning.

“If Khaleda Zia is able to prove her innocence, she will remain in politics, if not, then she must quit from politics,” Inu further said.

Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said a special tribunal would be formed for the quick disposal of cases against Khaleda for instigating arson attacks during the BNP-led alliance's agitation for three months since January.

"There is a provision under section-27 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 2009 for constituting anti-terrorism special tribunals. The government has plans to set up such tribunals in line with the provision,” Hasina said in parliament in response to a question from a lawmaker.
