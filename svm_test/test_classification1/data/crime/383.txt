11 JP men held for distributing forged letters
Police yesterday arrested 11 activists of Jatiya Party (JP) from Boirati in Mithapukur on charge of distributing controversial leaflets and letters with forged signature of Awami League (AL) acting General Secretary Sayed Ashraful Islam.

Several JP activists were distributing letters with so-called 'signature' of Sayed Ashraful Islam, asking HN Ashiqur Rahman, the AL candidate for Rangpur-5 constituency, to stop his campaign and work for 'grand alliance candidate' SM Fakhar-uz-Zaman, said sources at Mithapukur Police Station.

Police said the letter was forged as Sayed Ashraful Islam did not issue such instruction for HN Ashiqur Rahman.

JP candidate Fakhar-uz-Zaman and AL candidate HN Ashiqur Rahman are contesting for Rangpur-5 constituency as the two parties failed to settle grand alliance candidature for the seat.

When contacted, Fakhar-uz-Zaman said, "The arrestees are not activists of Jatiya Party and none of the party in Mithapukur has any connection with the leaflets and letters that police seized."

AL candidate HN Ashiqur Rahman said, "The fake letters and leaflets were published and distributed to deceive the voters."
