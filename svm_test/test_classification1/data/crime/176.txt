Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) today claimed to have arrested an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) expert of Sarwar-Tamim group of banned Islamist outfit Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) in Uttara of Dhaka.

Mushfiqur Rahman Jeny, a student of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), was held with a huge cache of IEDs and remote controlled devices, Jahangir Hossain Matubbar, commanding officer of Rab-10, said at a press briefing at Rab Media Centre in Karwan Bazar.

Hailing from Nimshar village ub Burichang area of Comilla, Jeny, in primary interrogation, admitted to being an IED expert and said he trained his cohorts on IEDs, the CO said.

The elite force came to know about Jeny from 15 other JMB members recently arrested from different parts in the country.

Jeny, a student of Computer Science and Engineering Department, enrolled into Buet in 2005 and is still unable to complete his studies.

The arrestee also said he along with the 15 other arrested JMB members were working on developing a device to carry out subversive activities. They planned on carrying out an attack on a government structure near the Cantonment, Matubbar said.

They also carried out an explosion as a test in a quiet area outside Dhaka, he added.
