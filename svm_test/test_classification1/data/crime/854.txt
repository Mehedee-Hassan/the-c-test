The inspector general of police, AKM Shahidul Hoque, on Tuesday claimed that murder of ruling Awami League lawmaker Manjurul Islam Liton is a stray incident.

‘Although it is taking time, police certainly will arrest the killers of the lawmaker,’ he said.

The police chief was talking to journalists at noon before joining Rangpur divisional law and order committee meeting at Police Hall.

MP Liton was shot at point blank range by some miscreants at his village home at Masterpara of Sundarganj in Gaibandha on December 31.

The MP was admitted to Rangpur Medical College Hospital where physicians declared him dead.

The IGP said police have been working neutrally to look into the killing.

‘We are sincerely examining everything what comes before us during the investigation.’

Responding to a query on the deterioration of law and order situation in the country including the killing of MP Liton, the police chief declined to accept word ‘deterioration’.



‘The law and order situation in the country is better than any time in the past and it is being applauded at home and in abroad,’ Shahidul Hoque added.
