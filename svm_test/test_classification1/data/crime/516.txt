Forgery in CSB's frequency allocation
A probe body of the information ministry has recommended that the government cancel the frequency allocation to the Focus Multimedia Company, which runs CSB News satellite TV channel, for 'forgery'.

The five-member probe body headed by the ministry's Joint Secretary (development) Kamal Uddin found that the CSB News got the frequency allocation by submitting a fake application two days before submitting the original one to the information ministry on October 19, 2006.

Sources said getting frequency allocation through forgery is a punishable offence, which can lead to cancellation of the allocation under the Telecommunications Act, 2001.

Although CSB has got the frequency allocation, the CSB authorities are yet to submit the original application to the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), the sources added.

CSB submitted an approval letter of the information ministry to the BTRC on October 17 and got the frequency allocation. The probe body found that the signature on the approval letter was forged. The information ministry did not issue any approval letter to the CSB on that day.

The probe body formed on July 31 observed that the CSB News might have an ill intention in getting the frequency allocation. It also said some officials of the information ministry were involved in the forgery.

Meanwhile, CSB Manager (administration) Chowdhury Mahmud Hussain in a press statement said the approval letters were issued by the information ministry on October 17 and 19.
