Govt using law enforcers to crush movement: BNP
BNP has accused the government of carrying out killings, abductions and repression on the 20-party alliance men using law enforcement agencies and its political cadres.

“The government is doing so to crush the ongoing peaceful movement,” said a press statement issued this evening by BNP Joint Secretary General Barkat Ullah Bulu.

In the same way Salahuddin Ahmed, another joint secretary general of the party, has been abducted 13 days ago and remains missing since then, Bulu alleged.

BNP also expressed hopes that the government would come forward to resolve the prevailing political crisis through dialogue for the sake of the country and its people.
