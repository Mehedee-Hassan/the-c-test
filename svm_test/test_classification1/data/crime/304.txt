Man held for ‘attempting’ to kidnap RU student
Police today arrested a man for his alleged attempt to kidnap a student of Rajshahi University introducing himself as a member of Detective Branch of police.

The arrestee was identified as Uzzal Hossain, 30, of Mirzapur in Rajshahi city, reports our RU correspondent.

Victim Nuruzzaman, a third year student at statistics department, said Uzzal and his cohort, introducing themselves as DB personnel, intercepted him when he was crossing the university main gate around 12:45pm.

“As I wanted to see their identity cards, they tried to pick me up forcefully on their motorbike,” he told The Daily Star.

Hearing my screams, some students rushed there and caught Uzzal red handed while his cohort managed to flee the scene, Nuruzzaman said.

Later, the students handed Uzzal over to the on-duty police after giving him a good beating.

Contacted, ADM Rezaul Karim, officer-in-charge of Motihar Police Station, said they will take legal action against the arrestee after investigation.
