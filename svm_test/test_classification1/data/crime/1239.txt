Hijacked car of Nanak's PS recovered
Detective Branch (DB) of police yesterday recovered the hijacked private car of Matiur Rahman, private secretary of state minister for LGRD and Co-operatives Jahangir Kabir Nanak, from Chenguria village in Jessore.

Miscreants hijacked the car on April 12 in the capital's Uttara firing shots at driver Faruque Hossain.

Sources said DB personnel recovered the vehicle at the house of Matiur Rahman, a Bangladeshi expatriate in the USA, at Chenguria village following the information given by Sirajul, arrested in the city two days ago.

The DB members suspect that Matiur's son Hirok was involved in the hijack. Earlier, a stolen motorbike was seized from his possession.

Abu Bakkar Siddiq, officer-in-charge of Abhaynagar Police Station, told The Daily Star that the car was taken to Chenguria village for selling it on the black market.
