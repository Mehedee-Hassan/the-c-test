Amini, 8 others charged with looting house
The charge sheet of a looting case against former lawmaker and chairman of a faction of Islami Oikyo Jote (IOJ) Mufti Fazlul Haque Amini and eight others was submitted yesterday.

Sub-inspector (SI) Kazi Barkat Ali of Lalbagh Police Station, also the investigation officer (IO) of the case, submitted the charge sheet against them to the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court showing 27 people as prosecution witnesses.

The other accused are Mufti Taiyab, Moulana Hedayetullah, Mufti Abul Khair, Mohammad Ali Hossain, Khaled Mosharraf, Shafiqur Rahman, Mizanur Rahman and Saiful Islam.

Of the accused, Amini and six others were granted bail by the High Court on March 11 while Mizan and Saiful have been absconding.

The IO prayed for issuing arrest warrant against them and an order to attach their properties. He also dropped the names of 13 other accused from the charge sheet, as their involvement in the incident was not found.

Moulavi Rashid Ahmed filed the case against Amini and 21 others on February 27 for looting valuables worth about Tk 30 lakh from his house at Barakatra in the capital on June 9, 2003.
