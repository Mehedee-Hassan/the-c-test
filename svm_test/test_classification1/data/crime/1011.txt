Housewife murdered for dowry
A housewife was murdered allegedly by her husband for dowry at Sovarghop village in the sadar upazila on Thursday night.

The deceased was Sheuli Rani Das, 23, daughter of Sunil Das of Nalia village of Lohagara upazila.

Family sources said Sheuli was married to Arup Da, son of Nirapod Da of the same village, two years ago.

Victim's father alleged that Arup had been demanding more money for dowry from him although he gave a good amount to him during the marriage.

Arup and his family members used to torture Sheuli for dowry since the inception of the marriage, he added.

On that night, following his wife's refusal to go to her father's house to bring the dowry, Arup beat Sheuli indiscriminately.

Hearing hue and cry, neighbours rushed to the spot and took her to Narail Sadar Hospital where the doctor declared her dead.
