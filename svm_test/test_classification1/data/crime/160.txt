Arms, explosives recovered from ‘Jhenidah Neo JMB den’
Law enforcers today claimed to have recovered a huge stash of arms and explosives including suicide vests and pressure-cooker bomb from a suspected hideout of Neo JMB in Jhenidah Sadar upazila this evening.

A joint team of police, CTTC, Rab and Swat conducted a raid at the “hideout” in Porahati village around 5:00pm, said Mahidul Islam, deputy commissioner of the Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit of Dhaka Metropolitan Police.

A huge stash of arms and explosives including three to four suicide vests and a pressure-cooker bomb were recovered from the hideout, he told The Daily Star.

“The militants managed to flee the scene sensing the presence of law enforcers, the DC said, adding “We primarily suspect it was a hideout of Neo JMB militants.”
