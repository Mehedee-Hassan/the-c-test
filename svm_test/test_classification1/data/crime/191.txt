Gold smuggling ring member on remand
A Dhaka court yesterday placed Monowarul Huq, a member of a gold smuggling ring, on a seven-day remand.

Police produced him before Metropolitan Magistrate Hasibul Huq and sought a 10-day remand for him to know the names of others in the gang.

Law enforcers arrested 46-year-old Monowarul at Shahjalal International Airport on Monday while he was bringing in 13.6 kilograms of gold worth around Tk 7 crore from Dubai.

Following the seizure of 117 gold bars, the arrestee disclosed the name of Abdul Aziz, a field officer of National Security Intelligence (NSI). Aziz had assured him of taking the gold away from the airport.

Talking to The Daily Star, Monowarul admitted that he had carried 2.5 kgs of gold last month and handed it over to Aziz.

Sources at the NSI said the authorities have recently withdrawn Aziz from his duty at the airport.
