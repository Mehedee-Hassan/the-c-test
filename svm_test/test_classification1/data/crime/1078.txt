Lucho falls victim to burglary
Didier Deschamps expressed concern Friday after revealing that star midfielder Lucho Gonzalez was the latest Marseille player to fall victim to armed burglars.

Lucho was at home in Aix-en-Provence when four individuals broke into his apartment late on Thursday. They stole bank cards, jewellery and other valuable belongings before escaping in the Argentinian player's car.

Marseille coach Des-champs said Lucho handed over his personal effects and had been left unharmed.

"Obviously he's very upset, who wouldn't be upset or shocked by such an incident?" said former France international Deschamps, who led Marseille to the league title last year.
