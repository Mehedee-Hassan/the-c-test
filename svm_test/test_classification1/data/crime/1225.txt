A Mymensingh court today placed five members of outlawed Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) on a three-day remand in the two cases filed in connection with snatching three JMB militants in Trishal in February this year.

The accused are Fatema Begum, Zakaria, Al Amin, Rasel and Sayed Ziaul Haque.

Fatema is wife of Sajid, a Bangladeshi national and chief commander of JMB. Sajid, the main accused in Burdwan blast, was arrested in West Bengal on November 8.

The Cognisance Court No. 4 of Farzana Yesmin granted their remand after officials of Criminal Investigation Department of Dhaka produced them before the court seeking 10-day remand for each.

The court also sent the JMB members to Mymensingh Central Jail.

Armed JMB militants ambushed a prison van and snatched away three party men in Trishal upazila of Mymensingh on February 23.

A police constable was killed as the attackers opened fire and hurled crude bombs at the prison van at Signboard point of Aminabari area. The dead, Atiqul Islam, was posted at Gazipur Police Station.

Police filed two cases against the JMB men with Trishal Police Station---one under the Explosive Substances Act and another for snatching three militants by ambushing a prison van and killing a constable.
