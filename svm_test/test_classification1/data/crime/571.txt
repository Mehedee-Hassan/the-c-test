Retailers among 21 detained for SIM forgery
Law enforcers today claimed detention of three people, including an alleged official of mobile operator Airtel, on charge of selling SIM cards registered with false information.

About 18 others are now in custody for quizzing in this regard, Biplob Kumar Sarker, police deputy commissioner (Tejgaon), said in a press briefing held at his office this afternoon.

The three detainees were identified as Moumin Mia, 40, Shafiqul Islam, 25, distributors of Airtel, and Wahid, 43, a territory sales manager of the telecom operator.

Airtel has acknowledged the issue and a spokesperson told The Daily Star this afternoon that they are preparing an official statement in this regard.

After detentions yesterday, police went up to Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) and called up the authorities at Airtel office in this regard.

Airtel’s Chief Service Officer Rubaba Dowla told The Daily Star last night that the company will “do everything to ensure compliance”.

Government made mandatory for SIM re-registration with biometric finger prints which started from 16 December last year and concluded May 31 this year.
