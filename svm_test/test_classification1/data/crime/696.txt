‘IT expert’ Zoha goes missing
An “IT expert”, who talked to different media as a cyber security specialist after the recent heist from Bangladesh Bank account, has been missing since Wednesday night, family claimed.

Tanvir Hasan Zoha, 32, was abducted from Kachukhet area around 1:00am while he was returning to his Kalabagan residence with a friend by a CNG-run three-wheeler, Kamrun Nahar, wife of Zoha, told The Daily Star.

Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal meantime said the law enforcers might have picked him up for questioning. But he said he was not certain about it, Bangla daily Prothom Alo reports.

The minister was talking to journalists at a programme at Krishibid Institution in Dhaka this afternoon, according to Prothom Alo.

Zoha’s wife said she last talked with him over the phone around 11:30pm Wednesday. But his mobile phone was found switched off since 12:15am, she added.

Quoting Zoha’s friend Yamir Ahmed, who was accompanying him on the night in the three-wheeler, his family members said some unknown people forcefully picked them up in a microbus intercepting their vehicle. Yamir was dropped at Manik Mia Avenue around 2:00am, they added.

Yamir informed the Zoha’s family about the incident later, family said.

Family alleged that they failed to lodge a general diary in this regard as police at Kalabagan, Kafrul, Cantonment and Bhasantek police stations decline to record it saying that the place of the occurrence does not fall in their jurisdiction.
