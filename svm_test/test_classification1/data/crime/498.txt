Nomination of Dimla Upazila Jamaat Ameer Moulana Ishaque Ali and Islami Oikya Jote (IOJ) leader Moulana Monjurul Islam were cancelled yesterday for signature forgery. Both parties are components of the BNP-led four-party alliance.

They filed nomination papers from Nilphamari-1 (Domar-Dimla) constituency as independent candidates.

The four-party alliance candidate in the constituency is Dr Rafiqul Islam, former prime minister Khaleda Zia's brother-in-law and father of ex-MP Shahrin Islam Tuhin, whi is not eligible to run in the election race as he has been convicted for 20 years in two cases.
