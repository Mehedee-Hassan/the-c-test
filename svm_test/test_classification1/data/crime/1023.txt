A newly wed housewife was tortured and her hair shaved off allegedly by her husband and in-laws at Molankhori Miajipara village in Sadar upazila on Friday last.

Police arrested the victim's husband Moshiur Rahman on Wednesday night after her father Yasin Ali filed a case with Thakurgaon Police Station in this connection the same day.

According to the case, Khadiza Begum, 19, daughter of Yasin Ali of Bothina village in Rajagaon union under Sadar upazila was married with Moshiur, 28, son of Sirajul Islam of Molankhari Miajipara village eight months ago.

Khadiza's father gave Tk 1.15-lakh during her marriage to her husband, family sources said.

After a month of their marriage, Moshiur and his family members demanded an additional Tk 2.5-lakh from her father.

As she failed to bring the amount, Moshiur and her family members started to torture her physically and mentally to realise the dowry.

On Friday, Moshiur and his family members started to torture Khadiza. At one stage, they shaved her hair and confined her to the house.

Hearing the news from neighbours, Khadiza's parents rescued her from her in-laws house and admitted her to Thakurgaon Sadar Hospital on Tuesday.

Contacted, the victim's elder brother Ariful Islam told this correspondent over cell phone that Khadiza herself got released from the hospital as she was unable to bear the shame of replying to various questions by people and newspaper reporters.
