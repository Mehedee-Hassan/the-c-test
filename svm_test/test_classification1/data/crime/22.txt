Thieves within!




A justified, and fairly detailed report criticizing the National Museum management was published on 7 July in a local English daily. In my opinion, the head of the organisation must be taken to task for being responsible for the deplorable state of affairs, when his people can steal gold and silver coins and other valuable artefacts from the premises. It is ironic that the custodians of treasure are treasure hunters and thieves themselves!

It seems that the National Museum is run by a gang of thieves. They must be found out and not only dismissed from service their crimes, but also be criminally punished for this culpable crime against the nation!

It highlights the total incompetence and irresponsibility of the Museum management. Whatever things that this 'criminal and incompetent' management tries to do now, apart from covering up their crimes will be totally irrelevant. If needed the total management should be replaced with people of intelligence and integrity, not simply honest 'fools', if one may say so!

Surprisingly, the authorities mismanaging the National Museum, even the ministry concerned has not suspended the responsible officials. Why has this not been done? Are they busy now in wasting more money in cataloguing the missing pieces to set up a parallel 'virtual museum' with photographs and descriptive background? It seems the authorities do not seem to care! It is possibly 'easy come; easy go' situation that is now prevailing there!
