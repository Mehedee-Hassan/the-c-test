Forensic report confirms rape of female cop
Evidence of sexual intercourse was found in the forensic report of the policewoman allegedly gang-raped by her estranged husband and his cohorts on June 14 at Khilgaon, Dhaka.

“The forensic report has confirmed that sexual intercourse had taken place, and there is evidence of rape,” said Prof Habibuzzaman Chowdhury, chairman of forensic department at the Dhaka Medical College.

“Since the rape victim was a divorcee, and a mother of a child, it is difficult to say for sure if the 25-year-old female cop was gang-raped or not. However, she was raped for certain,” the forensic expert told The Daily Star.

The forensic test was carried out on June 14, 2015. The report was finalised and sent to the One-Stop Crisis Centre (OCC) of Dhaka Medical College Hospital on June 16.

The Khilgaon police station will collect the medical report from OCC for their investigation into the rape case.

The victim yesterday told journalists that her estranged husband with three others raped her after sedating her when she went to his house to see her three-year-old daughter.

She managed to flee the house Thursday afternoon and later went to Khilgaon Police Station to file a case but the on-duty policemen said they would accept a case only after investigation, the woman said at One-Stop Crisis Centre (OCC) at the DMCH.

Khilgaon police recorded a case yesterday against the accused assistant sub-inspector. The husband was transferred to Special Security and Protection Battalion from Khilgaon Police Station on Thursday.

The cops also arrested one Rahman in this connection.

Anwar Hossain, deputy commissioner (Motijheel) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, told The Daily Star that action would be taken if the policeman was found guilty.
