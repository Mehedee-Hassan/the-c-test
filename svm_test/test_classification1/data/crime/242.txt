Three Asian men died yesterday after being hit by a car during riots in the central English city of Birmingham, officials said, as witnesses said they died while trying to protect their community from looters.

Police said they had arrested a man and launched a murder inquiry after the incident which happened at around 1:00 am (0000 GMT) as Britain's second largest city suffered from another night of riots.

Paramedics said they found around 80 people at the scene after the men were hit by the car. Two of the men were pronounced dead on the spot and the third died later in hospital.

Witnesses and family members said the victims were Asian men and were part of a group protecting the area from looting after local people had left a local mosque.
