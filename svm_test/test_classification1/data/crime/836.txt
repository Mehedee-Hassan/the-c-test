8 MONTHS AFTER MURDER: Justice for Drik official demanded
The family, colleagues and rights activists on Thursday demanded justice for Drik official Irfanul Islam who was murdered eight months ago.

They held a rally after forming a human chain in front of Drik Gallery at Dhanmondi in Dhaka in the afternoon.

The sincerity of the law enforcing agencies was called into question by the speakers as the criminals were yet to be identified and apprehended even after eight months of the killing.

Irfan, who worked for Drik for more than 20 years, left his office to withdraw Tk 3.08 lakh from a Dutch-Bangla Bank branch at Dhanmondi at around noon on April 2 but did not return the office.

His body was found at Jalkuri in Narayangaj in the afternoon; around five hours after his went missing.

A case was filed with Kalabagan police station that was shifted twice from Detective Branch to Police Bureau of Investigation. But the law enforcers were yet to unearth the motive behind the killing and link anyone to the murder.
