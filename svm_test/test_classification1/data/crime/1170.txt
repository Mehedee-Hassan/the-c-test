The case was under investigation, she said.

‘We will file an application to the tribunal on Sunday to show them arrested in the war crimes case,’ the prosecutor said.

The five were members of Razakar Bahini and involved in committing crimes against humanity at places in Batiyaghata during the liberation war, she added.
