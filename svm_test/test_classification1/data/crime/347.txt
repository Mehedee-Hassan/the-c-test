Diplomat kidnapped in Pakistan is alive, says Iran
An Iranian diplomat kidnapped last month in Pakistan is alive, Tehran's ambassador to Islamabad was quoted by a newspaper as saying yesterday.

Gunmen kidnapped Hashmatullah Attarzadeh on his way to the consulate in Peshawar in northwest Pakistan on November 13 and killed his local guard.

"The embassy's efforts to locate him have been somewhat satisfactory and we have learned with Pakistani security officials' help that he is alive," Mashallah Shakeri was quoted as saying by mass-circulation Hamshahri newspaper.

"We hope he will return to his family soon," the Iranian ambassador added.

There has been a recent surge in violence in Peshawar blamed on Islamic militants from the ousted Taliban regime, while Pakistani troops have increased operations along the country's porous border with Afghanistan.

Iran has strongly condemned the "terrorist" kidnapping in its eastern neighbour and made it clear that the diplomat's safety was Islamabad's responsibility.
