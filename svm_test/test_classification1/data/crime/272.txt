2 Brac officials kidnapped in Afghanistan
Two Bangladeshi senior Brac officials working in Afghanistan were abducted in the Ghazni province Thursday afternoon.

The identities of the hostages could not be known. Sources, however, said the kidnappers demanded $100,000 ransom for their release.

While talking to The Daily Star last night, head of Brac overseas programme Aminul Alam said a Brac team from the Afghan capital Kabul was sent to Ghazni after the incident. "We are waiting for details," he added.

Brac official Abdul Alim was shot dead in Afghanistan on September 13, 2007.

Another Brac official Noor-ul-Islam was kidnapped a couple of days later. He was held hostage for five months. He was released following a lengthy negotiation process.
