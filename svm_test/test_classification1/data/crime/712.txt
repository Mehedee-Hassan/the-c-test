A schoolgirl was raped allegedly by a local Juba league leader of Laxmipur yesterday evening.

The alleged perpetrator Jamal Uddin, who is the joint convener of Charshahi Union unit of Juba League, youth wing of ruling Awami League, has been absconding since the crime, said Ganesh Chandra Shil, a sub-inspector at Daserhat Police Outpost, reports our Noakhali correspondent.

Her brother filed a case this morning.

Locals and police sources said the accused tricked the girl to go to his rented house of Daserhat area while she was returning home from a friend’s house at around 8:00pm. Jamal then gagged her and raped her.

At one point, he fled the scene leaving the bleeding victim, according to the sources.
