Beware of car thieves
Beware of car thieves. They are active in major cities and towns under the umbrella of a strong racket, police sources said yesterday, reports UNB.

The racketeers steel two vehicles a day on average in the capital, but police can seldom recover the stolen cars, auto-rickshaws, motor cycles and trucks.

Gangs, active in Dhaka and other places of the country, maintain a chain among themselves. They include motor mechanic, motor parts traders and even a section of police personnel.

The sources said 51 different types of vehicles, like private car, auto-rickshaw, motor cycle and truck, were stolen in the capital city last month. Police could recover only nine.

Costly spares were missing from almost all the recovered cars.

In the current month, vehicles are being thieved everyday from different parts of the city at the same rate.

"Car owners feel insecure as police are unable to check the increasing car theft," said an executive of a transport owners association, who wanted not to be quoted.

The gangs steal and hide the vehicles very quickly. Most of those are taken outside Dhaka and then dismantled for selling their parts separately, police said.

The thieves have close links with some unscrupulous motor mechanics and spare parts traders, stationed in Dhoaikhal, Zinjira and some other places in and around the city, who help them in dismantling and selling the parts, they added.

Among different types of vehicles, auto-rickshaws are stolen at the highest rate. The second highest is motor cycle followed by private car.
