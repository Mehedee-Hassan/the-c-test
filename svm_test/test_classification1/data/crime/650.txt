HC orders post mortem on Nargis' corpse
The High Court today ordered the government to exhume and examine the body of the Bangladeshi citizen who was allegedly killed after rape in India two months ago.

Moved by a writ petition, the High Court asked the government to submit a post mortem report on the corpse of Nargis Begum before it by June 16.

The authorities have to submit the relevant documents regarding Nargis Begum’s body hand over to Sonadanga Police Station in Khulna by June 16.

The HC bench of Justice Quazi-Reza-Ul-Huq and Justice Abu Taher Md Saifur Rahman passed the order following the writs filed by the victim’s maternal aunt Rahela Begum and Alena Khan, chief executive of Bangladesh Human Rights Foundation.

Alena Khan told The Daily Star that they will ask local administration of Khulna to exhume the body of Nargis for its post mortem after getting the written order of the HC.

Nargis, 32, from Sonadanga of Khulna was allegedly raped and killed by criminals in Firozabad of Uttar Pradesh in March. She went to India with her daughter Kakoli and mother Anwara Begum on March 7 for treatment.

On March 9, the three started off for New Delhi from Kolkata by a train. When they reached a station around 3:30am the following day, some people approached them and said they had arrived in New Delhi, Nargis's mother Anowara told The Daily Star in April.

Getting off the train they left a bag behind which Nargis went back to retrieve. Criminals then kidnapped her and took her away in an auto-rickshaw, she said.

Uttar Pradesh police said they found her body near the railway line in Firozabad district in the second week of March.

Police chief of the state Pijush Sreebastab told BBC Bangla that Nargis was not raped. According to the post mortem report, she was run over by a train, he claimed.

After a post-mortem, whether she was raped and the real cause of death would be known, said Alena.
