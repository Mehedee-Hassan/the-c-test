BIWTA staff accused of embezzling Tk 19cr
The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has found proof of misappropriating Tk 19 crore by a former official of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) and his wife.

The BIWTA's suspended assistant accountant M Abdus Salam Khan and his wife Shahnaz Perveen Lovely colluded in embezzling and laundering the money, said ACC's Deputy Director Benjir Ahmed, who is investigating the case.

The investigation is nearly complete while the ACC has also approved submission of the final charge sheet against the duo.

"The charge sheet will be submitted to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court within a day or two,” Benjir said.

Salam misappropriated the amount from the BIWTA Provident Fund between January 2007 and November 2010, he added.

The BIWTA authorities suspended Salam on November 25, 2010 and the ACC filed two separate cases -- one for embezzlement of government money and another for laundering money -- against him and his wife with the capital's Motijheel Police Station.

Salam is now in jail while his wife Lovely on the run.
