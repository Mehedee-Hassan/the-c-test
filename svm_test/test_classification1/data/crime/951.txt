Recover Tk 8cr embezzled Viqarunnisa school fund
The teachers and students of Viqarunnisa Noon School and College (VNSC) yesterday urged the authorities concerned to recover the embezzled Tk 8.09 crore from the accused in the Viqarunnisa University Foundation graft case.

They made the call at a press conference at the VNSC auditorium on Baily road in the capital.

The VNSC teachers asked the education ministry to formulate a policy to safeguard them from undue political pressure they face every year during admission tests for the VNSC.

“We are compelled to enrol some students who fail to make it to the merit list in admission tests following pressure from the VNSC board of directors, government high-ups and politicians," Rokeya Aktar Begum, acting principal of the VNSC, told reporters.

Irregularities at the educational institution can be checked if the government formulates a policy in this regard, said Rokeya.

Expressing satisfaction over the verdict of the Viqarunnisa University Foundation graft case she said, "We are very happy with the verdict as the truth has triumphed," she said, adding that they hope to get back the embezzled money soon.

On April 10, 2004, the then acting principal of the VNSC Royena Hossain filed a case with the Dhaka District and Sessions Judge's Court accusing former Awami League lawmaker and ex-chairman of Viqarunnisa University Foundation HBM Iqbal and seven former members of the VNSC board of directors of transferring Tk 8.09 crore and properties illegally to the Foundation fund from the VNSC.

The court on Tuesday ordered them to pay the money by October 31.

The other accused are representative of Viqarunnisa University Foundation Abdus Sattar, former principal of the VNSC Hamida Ali, Humayun Kabir Khan, AKM Firoz, engineer Motiar Rahman, Rakibul Hossain Rumi and engineer Prasanta Kumar Biswas.
