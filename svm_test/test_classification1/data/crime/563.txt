Ex-Rajuk official held for Tk 1 crore graft
Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) today arrested a “suspended” official of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) for amassing about Tk 1.18 crore illegally.

A team of the anti-graft body arrested Salauddin Mia alias Ratan, a former office assistant of Rajuk, from Dhanmondi in Dhaka, said ACC Public Relations officer Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya.

Pranab said though Salauddin was a lower grade officer, he became owner of huge assets including cash and land worth Tk 1,18,18,285.

A case was filed against Salauddin with Ramna Police Station in January.

In April, ACC arrested a director of Rajuk in a fraudulence case.
