3 'JMB' men held with explosives in Narayanganj
Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) today claimed to have detained three active members of banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) in Sonargaon upazila of Narayanganj.

The detainees were identified as Md Mostafa, 25, Abu Raihan alias Himel, 24, and Md Shariful Islam alias Shaheen, 21, a correspondent reports quoting the elite force.

They were hatching plots for subversive activities ahead of the International Mother Language Day on February 21, Lieutenant Colonel Kamrul Hasan, commanding officer of Rab-11, claimed at a press conference later today.

Acting on a tip-off, a group of Rab officials carried out drives at different places in Kanchpur and Mograpara areas of Sonargaon from 4:00am to 6:00am and detained them with seven jihadi books, 46 leaflets, five machetes, five crude bombs and some bomb making materials, he added.

After execution of the death verdicts of the top brasses of the militant group, the trio has been carrying out organisational activities in different names and identities in the area, the Rab official added.
