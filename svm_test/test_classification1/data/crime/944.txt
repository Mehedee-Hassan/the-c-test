Four GB officials sent to jail for embezzlement
A Sunamganj court sent four Grameen Bank officials accused of misappropriating about Tk 14 lakh by creating 327 fake accounts to jail after their surrender on Sunday.

The officials of the bank's Pandargaon branch in the district's Doarabazar upazila committed the crime from 2007 to 2010. In this regard, the Anti-Corruption Commission filed three cases with Doarabazar Police Station in July 2011.

Branch Manager Md Mizanur Rahman and in-charges of three centres Mohammad Kamal Hossain, Saidur Rahman and Jahirul Islam have been absconding for six months after District Sessions Judge Md Israil Hossain, also judge of a special tribunal, issued arrest warrants for them in January, said ACC lawyer Ainul Islam.

The four created 327 fake accounts and drew about Tk 27.52 lakh as loans from Grameen Bank's Pandargaon branch. They embezzled Tk 13.92 lakh after depositing the rest with the bank.
