Dumped BMW ‘used for smuggling’ seized in Dhaka
Law enforcers last night confiscated an abandoned luxury vehicle with no legal ownership and false documents from a garage in Dhaka’s Jatrabari.

“No legal papers and ownership prove the car was bought with black money and was being used for smuggling,” read a press release of Rapid Action Battalion.

Tipped off, a team of Rab-3 lead by police Assistant Superintendent Aminul Islam recovered the car after they conducted a drive in Golapbaag.

Under quizzing, the caretaker of the house said a person named Abul Hosen, an acquaintance of the owner of the house, left the car in the garage over a month ago.
