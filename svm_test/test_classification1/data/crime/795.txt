Two held over Gazipur ATM booth robbery
Police have detained two persons in connection with robbing a fast-track ATM booth of Dutch-Bangla Bank Ltd at Harinhat in Gazipur's Kaliakoir upazila.

The detainees are Naimul and Mintoo. Mintoo confessed that he was involved in the robbery, police claimed.

The two were caught in separate drives from Rakhalia of Kaliakoir and Board Bazar of Tongi early yesterday.

Abdul Motaleb Mia, officer-in-charge of Kaliakoir Police Station, said Syed Afzalul Abedin, chief operator of security company Money Plant, filed a case in connection with Thursday's robbery.

In the case statement, the company mentioned that Tk 1.83 crore was looted by the robbers, the OC said.

"We suspect security guards and two officials of the organisation [Money Plant] are involved in the robbery," the OC added.

The police official on Thursday said they were skeptical about the role of the security company's seven staff, including two gunmen, who were on the spot during the incident, as they failed to resist the attack.

Around 2:30am on Thursday, some 10 to 12 robbers, equipped with sharp weapons and sticks, swooped on the ATM booth beside Dhaka-Tangail highway when the officials of Money Plant entered it to load money into automated teller machines (ATMs).

The gang beat up security guard of the booth and snatched two trunks filled with money.
