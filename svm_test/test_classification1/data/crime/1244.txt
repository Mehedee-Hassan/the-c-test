Army officer's car hijacked
Criminals hijacked a car from an army officer in the city's Mirpur area early yesterday.

Police said a gang of three muggers in a car halted Major Saiful Haque Ahmed's car near Purabi Super Market in Mirpur-11 while he was going to Mirpur-10 from Defence Services Command and Staff College at Mirpur Cantonment at about 4:00am for refueling his vehicle.

Major Ahmed was in civil outfit during the incident, police said.

The snatchers got down from their vehicle and got into the army officer's car at gun point, police said adding that two of the miscreants kept him at the back seat of his car while the other took control of the steering.

When they reached Khamarbari at Manik Mia Avenue, the thugs ejected him from his vehicle, received another cohort who was waiting for them, in the car and left the scene by the hijacked car.

They also took away Tk 4,000 and one cellphone set from the army man, police said.

Ahmed filed a case with Pallabi Police Station in this connection.

About the mugger's car, OC Mohammad Abdul Malek of the police station said quoting the case statement that all the three snatchers took part in the mugging leaving their car.

While contacted over telephone, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said they were not informed of the incident.
