Blogger Ananta murder : Sylhet court orders reinvestigation
Ananta Bijoy Das

A court in Sylhet on Tuesday asked the authorities concerned to conduct a fresh investigation into the blogger Ananta Bijoy Das murder and submit a supplementary charge sheet before it.

Judge of Sylhet Metropolitan Magistrate Court-3 Haridash Kumar passed the order.

Assistant public prosecutor Khokon Kumar Datta said the court rejected the charge sheet submitted by Criminal Investigation Department due to errors in the charge sheet as the CID had recommended exempting 11 people from the charge sheet.

On August 28, CID inspector Arman Ali submitted a charge sheet against five people in the murder case.

The accused in the murder case are Abul Hossain alias Abul Hossain, 25, Faisal Ahmed, 27, Mannan Rahi alias Ibne Moyeen, 24, Abul Khayer Rashid Ahmed of Faljur village in Kanaighat upazila and Harunur Rashid, 25 of Tahirpur upazila in Sunamganj. Of them, Mannan and Abul Khayer are now in jail while the others absconding.

The CID also recommended exempting 11 more people, including an alleged extremist blogger Shafiur Rahman Farabi, from the charge sheet as no evidence of their involvement in the killing was found.

On May 12, 2015, Blogger Ananta, also an activist of Sylhet Ganajagaran Manch, was hacked to death by a group of assailants in broad daylight at Subidbazar Bankalapara in Sylhet city.

Ananta Bijoy was also a writer of the ‘Mukto-Mona blog’, founded by blogger Avijit Roy who was murdered on February 26, 2015, two and a half months ago after he had come home from the USA.
