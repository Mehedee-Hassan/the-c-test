Two minor girls have been raped in Rayerbazar and Pirerbagh areas of Dhaka.

Both victims are attending treatments at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, said Bilkis Begum, a coordinator of one-stop crisis centre at the hospital.

In Hazaribagh: a seven-year old girl was allegedly raped by a youth at Rayerbazar under Hazaribagh Police Station last evening. One youth Khokan has been arrested in this regard.

Moinul Islam, officer-in-charge of the police station, told The Daily Star that a case has been filed in this regard by the parents of the victim. “One person has been arrested.”

The minor girl along with her parent lives at a rented house in Rairbazar area, he added. “Her father is a rickshawpuller and mother works as a maid servant in other houses.”

A miscreant entered the house Saturday evening and raped her when the parents were out, he said. Hearing screams, locals rushed to the spot and rescued the girl but the youth managed to flee.

In Mirpur: a nine-year old girl was raped allegedly by her neighbor in Pirerbagh area of Mirpur last night.

Talking to reporters in front of the DMCH, victim’s mother, who is a garment worker, said she returned home from her working place around 9:30pm last night and found her daughter sick.

“Russel, 37- year old neighbor entered the house when my daughter was watching TV and raped her forcibly,” she said. “I took her at the Mirpur Police Station first and then admitted her at DMCH around 3:00am.”

Medical tests of both victims were performed today and their report will be handed to authorities concerned after two or three days, Bilkis Begum added. “Primary tests confirm their rape status”.
