A college girl, who dreamt of becoming a doctor, was brutally killed allegedly by her husband for dowry at Bakchipara village in Sadar upazila yesterday.

A second year student of Pabna Islamia College, Rumana Khatun, 18, was wife of Awkat Hossain of the village and daughter of Rafikul Islam of the area.

She married her neighbour Awkat, son of Abdul Latif, without the consent of her parents last year.

After the marriage, Awkat, a worker engaged in setting tiles, and his parents often tortured her for a motorbike as dowry, said family sources.

“At one stage, he prevented my daughter from going to college. She had a dream of becoming a doctor,” said Poly Khatun, mother of the victim, adding that finding no other alternative, Rumana recently joined a local pre-primary school of Brac as a teacher

Early yesterday, her daughter was tortured to death following an altercation over dowry, she alleged.

However, Kazi Haniful Islam, officer in-charge of Sadar Police Station, said Rumana was hacked to death as the body bore stab injury marks.

The body was sent to Pabna Medical College Hospital morgue for autopsy, he said.

Police arrested Abdul Latif and Kulsum Begum, parents of Awkat, who went into hiding after the incident, in this connection, said the OC.

The deceased's father Rafikul Islam filed a case, accusing four people, including the husband, said the OC.
