Portable gen-set as dowry!
This interesting news item from Patna in India was published in the pages of a local English daily on May 18th. It adds a new twist to the saga of dowry demands; common in India! Usually these demands are for cash, land, furniture and often bi-cycle, motor-cycles or may be even a car depending on the wealth of the prospective bride's household! Portable Gen-Sets are a new item in the menu of dower demands claimed by the groom's parents, in power starved state of Bihar in India!

Considering the bleak power situation in Bangladesh now, may be this could be an interesting idea for prospective groom's parents in negotiating the items for dowry for marriage of their son. It is also reported that some prospective brides in Bihar, are refusing to go and live in their in-laws residences; because power supply in some localities is very scarce; often only for three hours during the twenty four hours in the day!

This is under the circumstances stated in the report; more or less an item of necessity, and expensive for many rural families. Only as an item of dowry it can be asked for, and also provided; since traditionally in rural Bihar dowry is an accepted expensive facility to be provided for a girl's arranged marriage!
