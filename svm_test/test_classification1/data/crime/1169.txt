Decision on indictment of four Moulavibazar war crimes suspects on April 17
The International Crimes Tribunal-1 on Tuesday set April 17 to deliver its decision about four war crimes suspects of Rajnagar in Moulavibazar, whether to indict them or not.

The three-member tribunal led by Justice Anwarul Haque set the date on completion of hearing from both the sides on charge pressed by the prosecution.

Of the four, detained Akmal Ali Talukder was in the dock. The other three, Abdun Noor Talukder, Anis Mia and Mosabbir Mia are still hiding.

All the four were members of infamous Razakar Bahini, the prosecution alleged.

The prosecution on May 30, 2016 pressed two charges against them - one for killing 59 and raping six and the other for killing two and torturing another one at Panchgaon area in the then Rajnagar thana.

Prosecutor Sheikh Mushfeq Kabir pleaded to indict the four suspects on two charges.

Meanwhile, defence lawyer Abul Hasan sought discharge of his clients.
