Russia accuses US of blackmail
Russia yesterday accused the United States of trying to blackmail it into a tough UN resolution on Syria's chemical weapons, as a mortar round hit Moscow's embassy in Damascus.

Opposing any resolution that implies force, Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday lashed out at Washington.

"Our American partners are beginning to blackmail us: if Russia won't support a resolution under Chapter VII in the UN Security Council, then we will stop the work in the Organisation for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons," he told Channel One, Russian agencies said.

The Hague-based OPCW is overseeing the inventory and destruction of Syria's chemical weapons under the agreement.

"Our partners are now blinded by their ideological goal of regime change (in Syria)" Lavrov said.

Lavrov's comments came as a mortar round slammed into the compound of the Russian embassy in Damascus, the first such hit against the site.
