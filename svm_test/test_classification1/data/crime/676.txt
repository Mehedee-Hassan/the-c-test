Shillong police get Salahuddin’s health report
Shillong Civil Hospital, where BNP leader Salahuddin Ahmed is undergoing treatment, has confirmed that he has been suffering from different ailments relating to kidney, heart, skin and urology.

“A new health complication has been identified along with his three previous ailments,” Subrata Acharya, India bureau chief of Somoy TV, told The Daily Star quoting a doctor of the hospital.

According to the medical examination reports the hospital authorities sent to the office of Shillong Superintendent of Police this afternoon, he has kidney, heart, skin and urology ailments at present.

Meghalaya police arrested Salahuddin on May 11 as he was “hanging around aimlessly” in Golf Links area of Shillong after nearly two months of his disappearance from a residence at the capital's Uttara on March 10.

Since he had no valid papers, identity proof or travel permit with him, Shillong police arrested and booked him under the Foreigners Act.

The BNP and Salahuddin's family members had been claiming that law enforcers picked him up, an allegation denied by the law enforcers and the government.
