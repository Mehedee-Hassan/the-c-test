Kidnapped Japanese tourist freed in Iran
Tokyo confirmed a report early yesterday that rebels in southeastern Iran had freed a Japanese tourist kidnapped in October.

Satoshi Nakamura, 23, was released "in good condition" late Saturday, a Japanese foreign ministry official said here.

"We confirmed his release and he told our embassy officials in Iran that he is in good condition," the ministry official said.

"But we still don't know about further details such as where he was released or when he can come back to Japan," he added.

The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported from Tehran that "several" rebels were arrested by local authorities.

Nakamura was abducted on October 8 in a region of southeast Iran bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan as he headed from his hotel for the ancient mud-built citadel of Bam in Kerman province.

He had been travelling alone after teaching Japanese and English in Nepal with a volunteer group.
