Court staff held in Rajshahi for stealing case documents, blackmailing another staff
Police yesterday arrested a staff of Rajshahi Joint Metropolitan Session Judge’s Court for allegedly stealing documents of a cheque forgery case four months ago and extorting money from another staff for giving them back.

Arif Ahammed Rocky, 35, an MLSS, was held on the court premises, said Rajpara police.

According to the case filed by Tofazzal Hossain Dalim, bench assistant of the court, Arif first took Tk 2,000 from him and later demanded Tk 4 lakh for telling him the whereabouts of the documents.

The cheque forgery case documents were found missing on October 31 last year. Wahedun Nobi Anu, assistant director of The Department Physical Education of Rajshahi University, also additional general secretary of Rajshahi District Sports Association, filed the case against one Shahriar Biddyut after the latter’s cheque worth Tk 11.50 lakh was dishonoured in 2013.

About the documents going missing, Dalim refused to make any comment.
