NSU dismisses pro-VC Meshquat for certificate forgery
North South University has dismissed its pro-vice chancellor ANM Meshquat Uddin for submitting a false PhD certificate.

Meshquat had joined NSU in June, 2013 claiming that he obtained a PhD from Cleveland State University, Ohio, USA.

However, following a probe, the NSU trustee board found that he studied at the university but did not obtain any PhD degree from there, says a press release.
