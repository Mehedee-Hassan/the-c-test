Guard jailed for sexual harassment of females
A Gazipur mobile court yesterday jailed a security staff of Kishori Unnayan Kendra for one year on charges of physically and sexually harassing the inhabitants of the centre.

The convict is Kawser Bhuiyan, 30, son of Harish Bhuiyan of Kishoreganj's Abdullahpur village.

Executive Magistrate in Gazipur Snigdha Talukder passed the order.

Snigdha told The Daily Star over the phone that Additional District Commissioner SM Mostafa Kamal along with other senior administrative officers went to the centre yesterday morning on a regular visit when a number of girls complained to them about the mistreatment by the guard.

A mobile court was immediately set up there and the accused confessed to his crime.

On Tuesday, Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha at a programme said after a recent visit to the shelter home he found that a number of girls had been getting sexually assaulted for years and awaiting trials.
