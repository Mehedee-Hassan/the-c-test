Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader on Monday said that the verdict of Narayanganj seven murder case proved that people of the country get proper justice and no one is above the law.

Narayanganj District and Sessions Judge’s Court awarded death penalty to 26 people including the main accused former Awami League leader Nur Hossain in connection with the Narayanganj seven murder case, while nine others were also sentenced for different terms.

‘The verdict also indicated that no one can escape from trial committing the criminal offences,’ Quader said while talking with the reporters after attending a programme organised by Awami League at Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy.

‘We also want to go beyond the culture of giving indemnity to someone, no matter how powerful they are.’ Quader said.

Quader, also the road transport minister hoped that the High Court would also uphold the verdict.
