ACC arrests two for 'embezzling Tk 4.2cr'
Anti Corruption Commission arrested two businessmen in Rangpur yesterday for allegedly embezzling Tk 4.2 crore through fake cheques.

ACC Assistant Director Jahangir Alam said Touhid Rafiq Chowdhury and Rafiqul Islam Khandakar withdrew the money from district account offices in Rangpur and Lalmonirhat.

Junior auditor of these offices -- Saidur Rahim and Gul-e-Saba -- abetted them in the embezzlement, he said, adding that they arrested Saidur in May.

Four cases were filed against them with Rangpur and Lalmonirhat police stations. Arrest of Gul-e-Saba is underway.

Meanwhile, the commission arrested in-charge of Rajbari food control office Kazi Hasibul Hasan and upazila food controller in Kishoreganj Abdul Jalil in a case filed for misappropriating Tk 20.22 lakh.

ACC said the officials while working at Karimganj upazila food office in Kishoreganj did not confiscate 1,183 sacks surplus food grains rather sold them out in black market.
