Dhaka Ahsania Mission (DAM) and World Health Organisation (WHO) will jointly organise a seminar titled 'Resistance of smuggling of tobacco products in Bangladesh' at the DAM auditorium here today.

DAM President Kazi Rafiqul Alam will preside over the seminar while Adviser to the Prime Minister Prof Dr Modasser Ali will be the chief guest on the occasion.

National Professor Dr MR Khan and Director General of the Department of Narcotics Control M Humayun Kabir will be present as special guests. Noted lawyer and Executive Director of Law and Trust Bangladesh Barrister Tania Amir will deliver the keynote speech at the seminar.

Talking to BSS, DAM President Kazi Rafiqul said a series of issues related to the illicit tobacco trade and adverse impacts of its use would come up for discussion.

"Nearly one third of the total tobacco trade in Bangladesh is being operated via international smuggling, resulting in fall in prices and rise in demand," he said.
