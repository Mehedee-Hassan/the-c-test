Another Savar bank robbery victim dies
Another victim of Ashulia bank robbery succumbed to his injuries at Enam Medical College Hospital in Savar.

Ayub Ali, 70, who had suffered stab injuries in his chest and belly, died around 8:00pm, reports our Savar correspondent.

Robbers stabbed the man while fleeing away after the incident at Ashulia’s Kathgora Bazar on the outskirts of the capital.

Miscreants shot dead seven people, including the manager of Bangladesh Commerce Bank’s Kathgora branch, and injured 25 others during a broad daylight robbery at the bank on April 21.

Angry locals caught two of the robbers – Raju and Mamun – and beat to death one of them. The other one was handed over to police.

The death toll now has gone up to nine.
