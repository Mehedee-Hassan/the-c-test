British national arrested for abusing child
Police arrested a British national in Dhopadighirpar area of Sylhet city yesterday on charge of abusing a 15-year-old boy for about a year.

Peter Ellison, 55, was detained from Metro International hotel. Police rescued the victim boy from the same hotel.

Police said Peter fled Dhaka to Sylhet and was staying in a rented room of the hotel since September 3.

Sylhet Metropolitan Police Commissioner AB Barua said they made the arrest following a five-hour raid along with a magistrate and British High Commission officials.

Barua said Peter took the advantage of poverty and allured the boy hailing from Naogaon under Shulla upazila, Sunamganj over a year ago.

He took the boy on short trips to Bandarban, Dhaka, and other districts and to Nepal, the official quoted the boy as saying on instant quizzing.

Barua said it is a case of child abuse, and things would be cleared up further on enquiry.

The boy, who claimed to be a student of class VI in Shulla upazila, admitted the man's foul behaviour, the SMP commissioner said.

Hailing from Bow area of Mile End, London, UK, Peter claimed himself as a documentary filmmaker on children. He declined to say anything further.

Sylhet Kotwali Police Station Sub-inspector Ikhtiar Uddin filed a case against Peter under "Nari O Shishu Nirjaton Ain". He was sent to jail after being produced before the Senior Judicial Magistrate Shamsuddin Masum's court. The victim boy was taken to safe custody.

Duncan Brown, second secretary, political affairs, British high Commission, Dhaka, who was present during the raid, declined to say anything about the arrest.
