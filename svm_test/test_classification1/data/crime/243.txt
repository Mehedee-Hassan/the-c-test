Thai tourism to lose $2.9b from riots: PM
Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva on Wednesday said tourism income was likely to fall by more than 102 billion baht (2.91 billion dollars) after deadly anti-government protests in April.

The same riots sparked losses of 220 million baht in damage to public property and loss of state income, according to the National Economic and Social Development Board (NSDB), the cabinet said in a statement.

Supporters of fugitive former premier Thaksin Shinawatra forced the closure of an Asian summit in Thailand on April 11, before taking to the streets of Bangkok where a state of emergency was declared for almost two weeks.

Street battles between protesters and soldiers left two dead and 123 people injured.

"Income from tourism this year is expected to fall by around 102.39 billion baht compared to 2008 due to the incidents in April, according to the NSDB," said Abhisit following the cabinet meeting.
