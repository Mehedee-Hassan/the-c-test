Manju gets bail in bribery case
The High Court (HC) yesterday granted bail to Jatiya Party (JP-Manju) Chairman Anwar Hossain Manju in a bribery case, in which he was convicted and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment.

The HC bench of Justice Wahhab Miah and Justice Marzi-ul Huq passed the bail order upon an appeal by Manju against the lower court verdict convicting and sentencing him in this case.

The bail will continue till disposal of the appeal, according to the HC order.

Manju's lawyer Ahsanul Karim told The Daily Star following yesterday's bail there is no legal bar to his client's release from jail as he earlier secured bail in other cases against him.

The case was filed against Manju, also a former minister, with Shahbagh Police Station on charge of taking Tk 77 lakh as bribe on July 25, 2007.

In the case, he was sentenced to seven years in prison on June 10, 2008.

He surrendered before the trial court on May 6 in connection with a corruption case, which was filed on charge of amassing illegal wealth and concealing information case, and the court the same day sent him to jail.

Barrister Rafique-Ul Huq appeared for Manju.
