Brickfield owner kidnapped
Members of outlawed Purba Banglar Communist Party (PBCP) early yesterday kidnapped a brickfield owner from his house at Bhuiaganti village under Solonga police station in Raiganj upazila.

The outlaws were demanding Tk 30 lakh as ransom for release of Shahidul Islam, 45, son of Join Uddin of Bhuiaganti village and owner of Bhuiaganti brickfield.

Police and victim's family sources said that a gang of criminals introducing themselves as members of PBCP had been demanding a big sum from Shahidul over cell phone for the last few days.

As he failed to pay the money, a gang numbering 15 to 20 wearing black mask stormed into his house at around 1:30am and picked him up at gunpoint in presence of his family members.

During abduction, the abductors also told his family members that Shahidul would be freed on payment of Tk 30 lakh ransom.

Contacted, officer-in-charge (OC) of Solonga police station said, they are investigating the incident and trying to rescue the businessman.
