'675 children abused in Jan-March'
A total of 675 children were abused across the country from January to March, says a study of Bangladesh Shishu Adhikar Forum (BSAF).

BSAF revealed the results of the study at a press conference at the Dhaka Reporters' Unity.

BSAF, a platform of 263 NGOs working with child rights issues that is supported by Danida, conducted the survey from published news reports in six national dailies.

The study also said that 129 children went missing and 46 were killed while seven were raped and a total of 11 children committed suicide during the period.

A total of 289 cases of abuse were reported in Dhaka division, the highest in the country.

Md Kafil Uddin, director of BSAF, said the number of missing children is alarming because missing children are easily subjected to all sorts of abuse especially human trafficking.

“The actual number of the incidents of child abuse might be higher as there are hundreds of cases all over the country that go unreported. Many incidents are settled through arbitration in the rural areas, which is a barrier towards ensuring safety of children,” he added.

Several propositions were made by BSAF at the press conference, including establishment of a nationwide toll free helpline to report child abuse cases faster.

“We currently have a helpline but people are reluctant to use it as they have to pay for the calls. A free call would definitely help improve the situation,” he said.

BSAF also suggested establishing a child-friendly legal system, a separate commission to deal with child rights issues, a separate cell in the police stations for children, adding child rights issues in the textbooks etc.

Salma Yasmin, coordinator of Networking and Advocacy for Child Rights in Bangladesh project of BSAF, also spoke.
