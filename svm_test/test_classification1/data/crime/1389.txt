Journalists protest assault on fellows
Protesting the assault on two journalists during the January 26 anti-Rampal hartal, over a hundred newsmen yesterday formed a human chain in the capital's Karwan Bazar.

They expressed dissatisfaction over the police authorities' "slow move" to punish its guilty members even though several of them responsible for the attack have already been identified.

Journalist leaders termed the Sagar-Runi murder case the glaring example of culture of impunity, as law enforcers failed to submit charge sheet in the case in five years.

Killing and assault on journalists are recurring due to an absence of punishment, they told the programme in front of ETV Bhaban.

Abdul Jalil Bhuyian, former secretary general of a faction of Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists, said the attack on journalists is basically an attack on the free press. It is not accepted in a civilised and democratic country, he added.

Terming the attack shameful, Shaban Mahmud, president of Dhaka Union of Journalists, urged the home minister to bring the guilty police personnel to book and ensure security of journalists.

Elias Khan, joint secretary of Jatiya Press Club, said the persons responsible for assault on journalists on previous occasions were identified in every incident, but "justice was not delivered." “It is the main cause for recurrence of such incident,” he added.

On January 26, police assaulted two journalists of ATN News while they were discharging duties during a half-day shutdown in the capital.

A three-member probe committee submitted its report on Tuesday holding eight police men responsible.

A day later, Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner Asaduzzaman Mia said guilty police men would get punished as per the gravity of their offence after analysing the report.
