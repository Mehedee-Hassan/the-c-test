4 ‘JMB militants’ arrested in Dohar
Members of Rapid Action Battalion claimed to have arrested four suspected members of banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) from a house in Dohar upazila of Dhaka last night.

The arrestees are Misbah, 19, and his brother Mahfuz, 16, sons of Abu Bakar Babul of Dohar, Taibur Rahman, 18 and Faisal Ahmed, 19, said Jahangir Hossain Matubber, commanding officer of Rab-10.

“They were members of the Sarwar-Tamim group,” the CO said at a press briefing at its media centre in Dhaka's Karwan Bazar area.

Rab members arrested Misbah and Mahfuz from Moura in Dohar upazila yesterday.

Acting on the information of the two siblings, they arrested Taibur from Narisha and Faisal from Judgepara last night.

Faisal left his house on March 26 for his so-called 'Hijrat' and his mother then filed a General Diary (GD) with Keraniganj Police Station in this connection.

During primary interrogation, the arrestees said they were planning to 'carry out subversive activities' at different places of the city.
