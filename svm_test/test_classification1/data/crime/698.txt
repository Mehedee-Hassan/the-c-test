A Sherpur court today sentenced three people to death and another to life term imprisonment for killing a schoolboy after abduction last year.

Convicts Md Abdul Latif, 22, uncle of the schoolboy, Robin Mia, 20, and Md Aslam Babu, 22, were awarded death penalty while Md Imran Hossain, 20, was sentenced to life, reports a correspondent from Sherpur.

All the convicts hailed from Sherpur district.

Judge Sayedur Rahman Khan of Women and Children Repression Prevention Court passed the order in presence of the convicts, Special Public Prosecutor Gulam Kibria told the correspondent.

Victim Arafat Islam Rahat, a class I student of Biplop-Lopa Memorial School, was son of Shahidul Islam Khokon in Gridanarayanpur area of Sherpur town.

A gang picked up Rahat on August 2, 2015 from in front of Shaheed Daroga Ali Municipal Park in the town when he was going to his father's timber shop in Shibbari area.

The abductors later demanded Tk 2 lakh as ransom from Shahidul over mobile phone. But, his body was found in a hilly area four days after he was strangled.

After the body recovery, the victim’s father filed a murder case with Sadar Police Station.
