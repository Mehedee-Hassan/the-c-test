A Sylhet court on Sunday fixed March 8 for delivering its verdict in a case filed for attempt to kill college student Khadiza Begum Nargis.

Metropolitan Session Judge Akbar Hossain Mridha fixed the date on completion of arguments by the prosecution and the defence.

A total of 34 witnesses, out of 37, made their depositions before the court in the case.

Khadiza, 23, daughter of Masuk Miah of Biswanath upazila, was stabbed by former Bangladesh Chhatra League leader Badrul Alam on her way back home from her college following the refusal of his proposal for having an affair with him on October 3, 2016.

She was taken to Square Hospital and on completion of treatment there she was shifted to Savar Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed hospital on November 28 last.

Badrul confessed to hacking Khadiza in his statement made under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on October 5 last year.

Police submitted chargesheet against the lone accused, Badrul, on November 8.

The court indicted Badrul Alam in the case on November 29.

After more than three months of treatment and intensive care, Khadiza returned home from CRP on February 24.

On February 26, Khadiza appeared before the court for the first time and made her deposition.

On March 1, the case was transferred to the Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court from the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate court as the court lacks the authority to give the highest punishment.
