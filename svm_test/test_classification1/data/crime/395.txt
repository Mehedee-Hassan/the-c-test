Tk 185cr credit fraud
Five traders of Khatunganj in Chittagong, who are also brothers, allegedly fled without paying due money worth around Tk 185 crore after purchasing wheat from several traders.

Agitating creditors locked the two offices owned by the defaulting traders -- M/s Chowdhury Enterprise and M/s Chowdhury and Brothers -- located at Nurul Absar Chowdhury Market.

A case was lodged with Kotwali Police Station on Tuesday night accusing Md Saiful Islam Chowdhury alias Junu, Md Saiful Azam Chowdhury alias Khokan, Md Saifuddin Chowdhury, Md Saifullah Chowdhury, and Saiful Alam Chowdhury on charge of fraudulence.

According to the victim traders, the accused five purchased DO (delivery order ) letters on credit of over one lakh tonnes of wheat worth around Tk 185 crore from some 60 traders.

But the cheques provided by the five were bounced by the bank, and the defaulters could not be contacted since then on, alleged the victims.
