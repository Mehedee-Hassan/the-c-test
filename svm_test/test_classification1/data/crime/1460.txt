The International Crimes Tribunal -1 on Wednesday directed the prosecution to press war crimes charges against Pakistan occupation army’s Bangali captain Muhammad Shahidullah on May 31.

War crimes prosecutor Abul Kalam informed the court that the prosecution had on March 21 received the probe report of War Crimes Investigation Agency against the accused.

The probe report, he submitted, was now under scrutiny.

He also submitted a copy of the probe report to the tribunal.

Shahidullah, 75, of Golaperchar, Daudkandi, Comilla, is in jail custody.

On Tuesday, the WCIA told reporters that during the probe war crimes investigator ZM Altafur Rahman found evidence of Captain Shahidullah’s complicity in war crimes on the soil of Bangladesh during the War of Liberation.

According to the prosecution, the accused took part in three incidents of crimes against humanity that were committed between June 7, 1971 and July 21, 1971 at different places under the then Daudkandi thana.

Only days before the Liberation War began Captain Shahidullah came to his village from the then West Pakistan and immediately reported to the occupation army command at Dhaka Cantonment, the prosecution said.

Later, Shahidullah was posted at Comilla cantonment.

Shahidullah set up a camp of the occupation army at Daudkandi from where he committed murders, arson attacks, looting, abductions, confinement and torture in confinement, the prosecution said.
