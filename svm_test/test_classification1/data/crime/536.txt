ACC relieves ex-Rajuk chairman of corruption allegation
The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has relieved former Rajuk chairman Md Nurul Huda of corruption allegation after primary enquiry, said official sources at the ACC.

The ACC in early 2015 launched an enquiry on the allegations that Huda amassed wealth beyond known source of income and took two housing plots – one in his name and another in his wife’s name both in Purbachal New Town – in violation of rules.

He took a ten-katha plot in his own name and a five-katha plot in his wife’s name under affected category, said the ACC sources seeking anonymity.

Later on, as ACC launched the primary enquiry, his wife applied for surrendering her plot in November last year and Rajuk later took her plot back accordingly.

The ACC recorded the primary enquiry findings on the allegations and relieved Huda of allegations, as he was earlier relieved of amassing wealth beyond known sources.

It was natural to relieve him of amassing wealth beyond known sources in case the allegation was found unfounded, said M Hafizuddin Khan, trustee member of corruption watchdog Transparency International Bangladesh.

But as Rajuk chairman Nurul Huda should have known the plot allotment rules and it was unbecoming and misuse of power to have taken land plots both in his name and his wife’s name, he said.

ACC Public Relations Officer Pronab Kumar Bhattacharya said that there is a subtle difference between resorting to “irregularity” and doing “corruption”.

In some cases, an accused is relieved of an alleged irregularity if the irregularity is rectified and a corruption case is not lodged unless there is adequate evidence of wrongdoing.

Huda went on retirement as chairman of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha in April 2014. He could not be readily reached for versions, as his mobile phone was found switched-off.
