Probe body over Ashulia cop murder
A three-member probe committee has been formed over the attack on police at Ashulia that left a police constable dead yesterday.

Md Shahidul Islam, additional deputy inspector general (Dhaka range) will lead the three-member body, our Savar correspondent reports.

Others in the committee are: Md Sayedur Rahman, superintendent of industrial police, and Kazi Asharful Azim, additional superintendent of Dhaka district police.

Md Habibur Rahman, superintendent of Dhaka district police, confirmed The Daily Star of the probe body and the members involved.

Unidentified assailants hacked to death a police constable and injured another in a sudden attack on a check-post on Dhaka-Tangail highway.

A case has been filed last night, suing unknown assailants, over the incident. However, no one has been arrested in this regard until last reported.

This morning, US-based for-profit SITE Intelligence Group said Islamic State (IS) has claimed responsibility for the attack on police in Ashulia.

The incident took place hardly two weeks after an assistant sub-inspector was stabbed to death by a youth at a checkpoint in the capital's Gabtoli.
