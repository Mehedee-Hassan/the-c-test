OC sued on bribery charge
A petition case has been filed with the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court in Magura accusing Shalikha Police Station Officer-in-Charge (OC) Shahidul Islam of demanding bribe over recording a case. Solaiman Molla of Shablat village in Shalikha upazila filed the case on Monday. In the case, Molla said he earlier filed a case with the same court on April 6 following a clash at his village. The court then asked the OC to take legal action after proper investigation into the incident. But the OC demanded Tk 10,000 from him as bribe for recording the case, Molla said. Chief Judicial Magistrate Sheikh Jalaluddin after hearing the petition issued a show-cause notice against the OC.
