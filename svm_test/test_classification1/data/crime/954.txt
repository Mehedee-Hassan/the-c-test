ACC charges four for embezzling Tk 2.5cr
Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) yesterday submitted a charge sheet against a fuel pump owner and three Janata Bank officials for misappropriating Tk 2,53,55,000 in connivance with each other through pay orders between 2008 and 2009.

The bank, adding the interest till yesterday, claimed Tk 2,86,77,000, said the charge sheet.

The accused are Parvez Rashid, owner of the Rahim & Rahim, a CNG and petrol pump in Sylhet city's Shibganj area; and the then Janata Bank's Kumargaon branch manager Mohammad Harun Shah, executive officer Md Abul Quashem and assistant officer Anup Kumar Das.

The officials were suspended and the manager later sacked.

The charge sheet stated that Parvez prayed for pay orders worth Tk 5,62,74,689 to Janata Bank's Kumargaon branch favouring Jamuna Oil Company Limited, Padma Oil Company Limited and Pragoti Traders from January 1, 2008 to June 18, 2009.

Parvez, having accounts with Janata Bank and National Bank's Shibganj branch, gave 19 cheques, nine of Janata Bank and 10 of National Bank.

Some of the cheques, worth Tk 3,17,40,000, bounced, but the officials, before checking those, issued the pay orders in total violation of banking rules.

After detection by an audit team, Janata Bank officials realised Tk 63,85,000 and filed allegations. The ACC, after a preliminary inquiry, filed a case with Sylhet Kotwali Police Station on February 25, 2010.

ACC, Sylhet Regional Office Deputy Director Md Jalal Uddin Ahmed, who investigated the case, submitted the charge sheet before the Sylhet district & sessions judge's court.
