Indefinite transport strike in greater Ctg
Transport workers enforced an indefinite strike in greater Chittagong from today protesting the abduction of one of its leader Nurul Islam.

Starting from 6:00pm today, the strike will continue in Chittagong, Khagrachhari, Bandarban, Rangamati and Cox’s Bazar districts until the abducted transport leader is rescued unhurt, Md Musa, president of Bangladesh Sarak Paribahan Sramik Federation of Chittagong unit, told our correspondent.

“We will refrain from operating all types of transport on the streets in greater Chittagong until we get back the missing leader,” the transport leader said.

No passenger bus or goods laden vehicle will be allowed to enter into or leave the Chittagong city during the strike, he added.

“We have talked to the concerned police station to take initiatives in rescuing him, but there is no progress yet even after 18 hours since the abduction,” Musa said.

A group of miscreants abducted Nurul Islam, general secretary of the local Human Hauler Sramik Union, from his Bandartila residence at gun-point around 10:00pm last night. Since then, he remained missing.

A general diary was recorded with Chittagong EPZ Police Station in this connection.

Abul Kalam, officer-in-charge of EPZ Police Station, said, “Neither family members of the victim, nor any transport leader have contacted with us after recording the general diary. We are conducting drives everywhere to rescue him.”
