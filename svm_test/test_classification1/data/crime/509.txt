7 arrested for document forgery
Bangladesh Police have arrested seven people last month in connection with the production of forged documents, used to support fraudulent visa applications, says a press release.

Police arrested them after receiving information from the British High Commission Immigration Section.

Arrested visa agents were found to have forged numerous documents, including bank statements, marriage certificates and sponsorship declarations. The forged documents were being sold to individuals making fraudulent student visa applications. Police have also arrested visa applicants who have illegally submitted forged documents with their student, visit and working holidaymaker applications.

A senior police officer said, “We are pleased with the outcome of these raids. Agents who produce and sell forged documents are simply exploiting people. Visa applicants should steer clear of them. Those who use forged documents will not only have their applications refused, but can face arrest and imprisonment under Bangladeshi law. We welcome the cooperation of the British High Commission.”

Jon Verney, head of Immigration at the British High Commission, said, “We warmly welcome genuine applicants for visits, study and work in the UK and we are always looking to provide the best possible service to them. Our systems help us recognise genuine applicants so that we can facilitate their legitimate travel to the UK more easily and protect them from identity fraud. ”
