JU teacher sacked for sexual abuse
Jahangirnagar University authority has sacked one of its teachers over charges of sexually harassing female students.

AKM Anisuzzaman, a lecturer of Accounting and Information System department was sacked in a syndicate meeting last night, reports our JU correspondent quoting Registrar Abu Bakar Siddique.

Based on the endorsement of a report filed by the university’s anti-sexual harassment cell, headed by Prof Rasheda Akhtar, the syndicate made the decision in its meeting.

The highest decision-making authority meeting was chaired by its vice-chancellor Prof Farzana Islam when the authority decided to sack him last night.

Earlier, the students of the department, and guardians of the victims lodged a complaint with the anti-sexual harassment cell on September 14, 2013.

On August 23, the cell carried out its investigation and recommended JU syndicate for suspending the teacher. A structured committee led by VC Farzana was also formed for further investigation.

The syndicate terminated the accused teacher from the university last night on basis of the committee’s report.

JU syndicate member Prof Kamrul Ahsan Titu said, "The syndicate accepted the recommendations of the probe body and took actions according to the University Act 1973 and anti-sexual harassment cell."

According to the act, the VC leads the committees looking into serious allegations against any teacher, said Prof Kamrul.
