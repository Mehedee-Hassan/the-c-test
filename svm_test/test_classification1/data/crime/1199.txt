Kalabagan twin murder: Family, cops sue unknown attackers
Two cases were filed – one by family over the murders and the other by police for assault on a cop – in connection with the gruesome Kalabagan double murders.

Minhaj Mannan, elder brother of slain LGBT magazine editor Xulhaz Mannan, sued unknown people over the twin murders with Kalabagan Police Station.

The second case was filed by Shamim Ahmed, a sub-inspector of Kalabagan police, who sued unknown assailants over the machete assault on Assistant Sub-Inspector Momtaz at the crime scene.

Nobody was arrested over the incident, said Mahmud Hassan, a sub-inspector of Kalabagan Police Station. Both cases were filed around 11:45pm last night.

Xulhaz, who is also a local staff member of the USAID, and his friend were hacked dead in their flat in the capital yesterday. It was said the attackers stormed into the house with weapons in hand, and stabbed a security guard and a policeman while storming out.

It was the second high-end killing of yesterday, after a drive-by shooting of a prison guard yards away from Bangladesh’s largest high-security prison. Just days ago, a Rajhsahi University teacher was hacked to death near his home.

Murder of Xulhaz drew strong condemnation from local and international quarters including the United States, United Kingdom and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).
