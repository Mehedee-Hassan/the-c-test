SC clears way for bribery case against Orion Group chairman
The Supreme Court yesterday cleared the way for resuming a bribery case against Orion Group Chairman Obaidul Karim.

On June 5, 2007, Dhanmondi police filed the case on charge of giving a car worth Tk 50 lakh as bribe to former prime minister Khaleda Zia's political secretary Harris Chowdhury to get the construction work order of the Gulistan-Jatrabari flyover.

The court yesterday stayed a High Court verdict that on September 25 quashed the proceedings of the case.
