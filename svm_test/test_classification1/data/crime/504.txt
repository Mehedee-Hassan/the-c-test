DCC sues Obaidul Karim and four others for forgery
Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) last night filed a forgery case against Belhasa Accom JV and Associates, the construction firm that saw its contract to build Gulistan-Jatrabari flyover scrapped Sunday.

DCC's acting legal officer MS Karim filed the case with Shahbagh Police Station, accusing the firm's Managing Director and Orion Group Chairman Obaidul Karim, a scamster on the run, and four others of forgery and cheating.

The complainant said the firm did not act according to the contract with the DCC. Besides, the accused had submitted fake and forged bank documents.

Shahidul Islam, officer-in-charge of Shahbagh Police Station, told The Daily Star that the case was filed at 9:00pm.
