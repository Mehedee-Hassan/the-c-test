2 ‘robbers’ killed in Cox’s Bazar infighting
Two alleged criminals were shot dead in a clash between two groups of robbers in Badshaghona area in Cox’s Bazar district town this afternoon, police said.

The deceased were identified as Nurul Alam, 46, ringleader of Alam Bahini, and his associate Mohammad Kalu, 26, said Aslam Hossain, officer-in-charge of Cox’s Bazar Sadar Model Police Station.

Aslam Khan, officer-in-charge of Cox’s Bazar Sadar Model Police Station, said the Nurul Alam Bahini had kidnapped a local businessman and extracted Tk 5 lakh in ransom.

The gang got into a dispute over sharing of the money with another local criminal band called Rana Bahini which triggered a gunfight, leaving the two robbers bullet-hit, police official said.

On information, police recovered the bodies and sent those to Cox’s Bazar Sadar Hospital where the doctors declared them dead.

Nurul was charged with 18 different criminal cases and Kalu in eight cases, informed the OC.
