Youths launch campaign for dowry-free marriage
A campaign for dowry-free marriage has been launched in Dilpasha union under Bhangura upazila, thanks to the initiative of some local youths and the chairman of the union.

The youths started the anti-dowry campaign with the help of UP chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh at different villages of the union last week.

As the part of the campaign, they helped arrange a dozen dowry-free marriages, including that of Afroza Khatun, daughter of Kurman Ali of Betuan village, Samia Khatun, daughter of Samsul Alam of Kutipara village, and Rafiqul Islam, son of Abdul Kuddus of Adabara village, in a week, said sources at union marriage registrar office.

"Though it is a difficult job to convince the parents of the proposed bridegrooms and brides not to take or give dowry, the youths have succeeded in their efforts to some extent," said Md Abdul Jalil, marriage registrar of the union.

Chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh said that the union parishad extended all-out support to the campaign launched by the local youths.

"We want to keep Dilpasha free from the curse of dowry," he said, adding that the youths have set an example which would encourage people of other areas of the upazila.

Several tragic incidents relating to dowry took place in the upazila in last few years. The union parishad and local youths have jointly launched the campaign to put an end to this immoral and illegal act, Ashok Kumar further said.

Members of Dilpasha union parishad have also joined the motivation campaign in their respective wards.
