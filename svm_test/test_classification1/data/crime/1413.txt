Pirojpur BCL men assault 2 journos
Two journalists including a district correspondent of The Daily Star were assaulted by the activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of ruling Awami League, in Zianagar upazila of Pirojpur today.

The journalists are Habibur Rahman, Pirojpur correspondent of the English daily, and Sirajul Islam, district correspondent of Bangla daily Khabarpatra.

According to the injured journalists, three BCL activists riding a motorbike chased Habibur and Sirajul when they were passing through Sankarpasha union by motorcycle around 1:00pm.

At one stage, the newsmen were knocked off their motorcycle in front of the village home of local AL lawmaker AKMA Awal.

As they fell on the ground, the BCL men led by one Jammie beat them up with GI pipes and bamboo sticks alleging that the journalists snapped their pictures when they were clashing with BNP activists in the upazila an hour ago.

"We told them that we did not take any picture of the incident but the attackers kept beating us," Habibur said.

The BCL activists also vandalised their motorbike and snatched Tk 800 before leaving the place.

The injured journalists received primary treatment from a local hospital.
