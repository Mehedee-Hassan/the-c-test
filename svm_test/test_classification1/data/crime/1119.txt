Police pick up one over TV offices burglary
A man was detained yesterday at his house in Ranibazar in connection with the burglary at Rajshahi bureau offices of five private television channels a day before.

Police picked up Habibullah Sayeed alias Rasel for interrogation after they found a camera of RTV at his house, said Shahadat Hossain, officer-in-charge of Boalia Police Station.

According to police, Rasel said he is a friend of Channel i cameraman Sayed Md Masud and RTV Rajshahi correspondent Foisal Ahmed Samrat.

Rasel, on the occasion of his child's birthday, borrowed the camera from Masud hours before the burglary, police added.

Channel i Rajshahi staff correspondent Abu Saleh Md Fattah said the camera was mistakenly listed as stolen valuables, because they could not instantly recollect that it was given to Rasel.

“We will decide about Rasel's arrest after interrogating him”, said OC Shahadat Hossain.

Some unidentified burglars stolen valuables worth over Tk 3.5 lakh breaking open the bureau offices of Channel i, Channel 1, Banglavision, ntv, and Islamic tv in Rajshahi city early Monday.

The miscreants took away laptops, computers, cameras, other electronic equipment, and Tk 3,500 in cash from the offices, says the complaint.

SM Saju, Rajshahi correspondent of ntv, lodged a case with the police station against unidentified burglars on the same day.

Arrest of Mohammad Kalu, the night guard of the building that housed the offices on its 2nd floor, followed the case filing.
