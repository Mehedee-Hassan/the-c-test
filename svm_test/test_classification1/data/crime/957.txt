The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) yesterday filed three cases against 23 people, including former principal of Bogra Azizul Haque University College Sultan Ali, 18 staff of the college and four leaders of Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) for embezzling around Tk 70 lakh from the college fund.

Birkanto Roy, assistant director of the ACC, filed the case with Bogra Sadar Police Station.

The accused BCL leaders are convener of the college BCL unit Abu Zafar Mohammad Mahmudunnabi Rasel, joint conveners Kamrul Huda Uzzal and Kamrul Hasan Dalim and the unit's former general secretary Aminul Islam Dablu.

According to the case statement, they misappropriated over Tk 69 lakh 70 thousand from the college fund in collaboration with some dishonest staff of the college during the period from December 18, 2007 to December 31, 2009.

The ACC filed the case after completing an investigation for eight months.

Mohammad Rashedul Hasan, college unit general secretary of Amra Muktijoddhar Santan (children of freedom fighters), lodged the corruption charge against the accused to the ACC in February this year.
