Case filed over Maldivian model murder
The father of Maldivian model and medical student Raudha Athif’s Monday filed a case accusing one of his daughter’s college mates with Rajshahi Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court.

The Maldives-born 21-year-old Raudha was studying at Rajshahi Islami Bank Medical College since January 14, 2016 whose body was found on March 29 in her room at college dormitory.

She was on the cover of Vogue India magazine in October 2016.

The solo accused of the case is Sirat Parvin Mahmud, an MBBS student of Rajshahi Islami Bank Medical College and hailed from Kashmir in India.

`Raudha was strangled to death’, the plaintiff claimed Athif’s father Mohammad Athif in his appeal.

Lawyer Kamrul Monir told New Age that the judge Saiful Islam took the case into cognisance and asked Shahmakhdum police to record and investigate it.

Earlier on Thursday Mohammad Athif said to newsmen that he was not satisfied with his daughter’s autopsy report.

Mohammad after filing the case said today, ‘I asked the autopsy team some important questions, but they failed to give any satisfactory answers. As I said earlier, there was something mysterious about the death.’

According to him, Raudha had phoned them the night before March 29, while she sounded perfectly normal, but was found dead the next morning.

He asked how the medical college authorities had brought down her hanging body without breaking the door of her room much earlier before police reached the scene.

Meanwhile, two Maldivian police officials have arrived at Rajshahi on Monday and separately talked with the medical college authorities over the death.

Raudha was buried on Saturday in Rajshahi after the autopsy report ruled her death as suicide.
