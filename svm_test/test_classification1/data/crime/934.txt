Shariatpur war crimes suspect dies at DMCH
A Shariatpur war crimes suspect died at the prison cell of Dhaka Medical College Hospital early Wednesday.

Sulaiman Mollah, 84, of Kashipur Muslimpara, died of old age complications, said DMCH police outpost in charge, sub-inspector Bachchu Mia, quoting physicians.

Sulaiman was the lone detained accused in the Shariatpur war crimes case.

He was a Muslim League leader who had formed Peace Committee and Razakar Bahini in Shariatpur in 1971, according to the prosecution.

The prosecution on Tuesday began closing arguments in the war crimes case against him and another suspect who is still absconding.
