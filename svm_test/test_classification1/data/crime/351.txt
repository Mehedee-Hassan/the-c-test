Prime suspect of Faridpur kidnapping arrested
Detectives in Faridpur yesterday evening arrested Syed Masum, the prime suspect in kidnapping five youths of the district.

Dadon Fakir, officer-in-charge of Bhanga Police Station, confirmed the arrest of Masum, member of a local crime gang known as Welcome Party.

The gang members phone people, introducing themselves as officials of mobile phone operators. The receivers then are told that they have won a lottery. But to get the prize money, they have to send credits to a certain mobile phone number, police said.

Rubel, 18, Belayet, 23, Kaiyum, 32, Sobhan, 19, and Fayez, 23, were abducted from Maligram Bazar of Bhanga upazila in the district on December 6. They are still traceless.

On Thursday, Rafiqul Islam, nephew of Rubel, at a press conference said one Nirob of Algadia village under Nagarkanda upazila called Sobhan over the phone around 2:30pm on December 6 and asked the 19-year-old to go to Maligram Bazar.

As Sobhan along with Rubel, Belayet and Fayez reached there, the gang hustled them in a microbus.

Police said this Nirob is none other than the arrested, Syed Masum. His brother Mobin, picked up by law enforcers Saturday, during interrogation said Nirob is not Masum's real name and that he is a member of the Welcome Party.
