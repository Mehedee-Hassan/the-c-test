JU expels 5 BCL men over sexual assault
Jahangirnagar University authority today expelled five Chhatra League activists of the university unit on charge of sexually assaulting a female indigenous student during Pahela Baishakh celebration.

The university syndicate made the decision this evening upon recommendation by the university’s Anti-Sexual Harassment Cell.

The expelled students are Nishat Imtiaz Bijoy, third-year-student of journalism department; Nafis Imtiaz, third-year-student of chemistry department; Abdur Rahman Ifti and Nurul Kabir, second-year-students of anthropology department; and Rakib Hassan of geography department.

JU Registrar Abu Bakr Siddique told our university correspondent that the decision was made at the university’s syndicate meeting as the allegation against them was proved during investigation.

The expelled students sexually harassed a female indigenous student, assaulted her male friend and snatched away their belongings near Munni Shoroni Road on the campus during Pahela Baishakh celebration.

On April 16, JU unit Chhatra League suspended the five over the allegation of sexual harassment.

The victim filed a complaint over the issue, while the Anti-Sexual Harassment Cell’s chief Prof Rasheda Akter investigated the allegation.

The student alleged that she was attacked while returning to her hall.

Meanwhile, many general students, following the decision, brought out a procession on the campus to celebrate what they called justice.
