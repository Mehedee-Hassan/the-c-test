HSTU students go berserk, vandalise admin bldg
Students of Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University went on the rampage after a fellow student was crushed under the wheels of a university bus on the campus yesterday afternoon.

They vandalised the administration building, demanding removal of the driver of the university as he was allegedly drunk while driving the bus.

When police reached the campus the students chased them, leading to a chase and counter-chase.

The situation was brought under control after the university authorities suspended the bus driver and formed a three-member probe committee to investigate the incident.

Witnesses said Mir Moniruzzaman, 21, a second year student of Agriculture faculty, was getting on the bus at around 3:50pm when the driver Chunnu Soren suddenly moved ahead. As a result, Moniruzzaman was crushed under the rear wheels and died on the spot.

Police have been deployed at the university campus to avert further untoward incident.

On April 3 this year, Rahima Khatun Rima, 24, a final year student of food engineering, was killed in a road accident just a kilometer from the university. Sajid Hasan, a student of the same department, was injured in the accident.

On the same night, Md Tito, 35, a helper of a university bus was killed under the wheels of a university bus while returning to the campus from Nawabganj upazila of Dinajpur. Chunnu Soren was driving that bus.
