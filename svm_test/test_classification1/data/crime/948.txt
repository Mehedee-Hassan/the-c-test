Postmaster sued for embezzling depositors' money
A defalcation case was filed with Kalaroa Police Station against postmaster of Kalaroa upazila main post office Mir Abdul Haque for misappropriating Tk 28,50,500 from depositors' fund yesterday night.

Abdul Haque, who was arrested on Thursday last, was produced before Judge Ranu Bilkis Banu of the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court at Satkhira, who sent him to jail rejecting his bail prayer yesterday.

Sub-divisional inspector of post offices SM Rafiqul Alam who probed the matter against him filed the case against postmaster Mir Abdul Haque after finding his involvement in the defalcation scam.

Over 30 people who opened accounts with the post office have been depositing money with their accounts opened with the post office, he said, adding that the accused postmaster misappropriated depositor's money amounting to Tk 28,50,500 by not recording deposited money with the ledger books of the post office. He did not even issue pass books to the depositors, he added.
