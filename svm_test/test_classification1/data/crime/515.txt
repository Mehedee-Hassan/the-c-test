SEC punishes Rajshahi Digital Plus for forgery
The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday fined a non-listed company Tk 10 lakh for submitting a forged certificate to get regulatory approval for raising paid-up capital.

Rajshahi Digital Plus Ltd submitted an application to the SEC on November 12, seeking permission to increase its paid-up capital.

But the regulator found the auditor certificate submitted along with the application to be false, the SEC said in a statement.

The stockmarket regulator also decided to blacklist the company, meaning it will never get permission to raise paid-up capital.

The SEC will also inform the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms, Rajshahi division about the company's forgery.

The market watchdog at a regulator meeting also fined managing directors and directors of four listed companies Tk 1 lakh each.

The companies are: Raspit Data Management and Telecommunications, Fahad Industries, Amam Sea Food Industries, and Khaza Mosaic Tiles and Stone Industries.

All four companies failed to submit quarterly or half-yearly or yearly audited financial reports to the commission within stipulated time.

At yesterday's meeting, the SEC gave permission to AFC Agro Biotech Ltd to increase its paid-up capital by Tk 2.96 crore.

The non-listed firm will issue 29.65 lakh ordinary shares of Tk 10 each to increase the paid-up capital to Tk 38 crore from Tk 35.03 crore.

The SEC also approved 20 percent quota for affected investors in the IPO of mutual funds.
