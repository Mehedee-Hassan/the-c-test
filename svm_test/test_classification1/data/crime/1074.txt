Burglary at DMCH
Burglars stole surgical instruments from the Operating Theatre (OT) of Dhaka Medical College Hospital's (DMCH) Neurology Department sometime between Wednesday afternoon and yesterday morning.

DMCH sources said the patients scheduled to have surgical operation in the OT were sent back due to lack of instruments yesterday.

Sub-inspector Wahidur Rahman Majumdar of Shahbagh Police Station said burglars breaking open the grills on the backside of the OT room stole at least 37 types of instruments.

But Brig Gen Bazle Kader, director of DMCH, could not be reached over phone.

However, some hospital employees said the burglars stole all the instruments except some fixed ones.

Sources could not ascertain the price of the stolen instruments and the time when the OT will be functioning.

Hospital sources said employees found locks on the main gate of the second floor were broken and the doors of the OT rooms were open around 7:30am yesterday.

The sources said the OT room was shut on Wednesday afternoon after several surgical operations were conducted.

A case was filed with the Shahbagh police station but none was arrested.
