Two Bangladeshis, not one, abducted by IS in Libya
Two Bangladeshi nationals, not one as learnt earlier, have been identified to be among the nine people abducted from an oilfield in Libya on Friday, the Bangladesh embassy has confirmed.

Initially Anowar Hossain was mistakenly identified as a Sudanese national having the same name.

Hossain, whose Passport No. is AE3630754, hails from Noakhali district, according to a foreign ministry press release.

Yesterday, the foreign ministry informed that Helal Uddin, bearing passport No-B0156553 hailing from Jamalpur was the only Bangladeshi among nine others held hostage by the terrorist group ISIS.

However, Anowar’s identification was confirmed by a Bangladeshi working in a neighboring oil field.

After this attack on last Friday, 21 Bangladeshis, who were employed in another neighboring oil field, were taken to safe places. Bangladesh Embassy in Tripoli is maintaining constant vigil on the matter.

The incident took place when gunmen invaded the oil field killing eleven guards, beheading a number of them, before local forces fought back to retake control.

Libyan Foreign Ministry informed the Bangladesh Mission that they were trying heart and soul to rescue the victims.
