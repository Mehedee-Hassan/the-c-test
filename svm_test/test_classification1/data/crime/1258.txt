Verdict reserved in Sharif plane 'hijack' case
The Supreme Court yesterday reserved orders in a case in which former prime minister Nawaz Sharif is accused of 'hijacking' an aircraft carrying then army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf by attempting to prevent it land at Karachi in 1999.

Concluding his arguments in the case, Sindh Prosecutor General Shahadat Awan maintained that Sharif had been rightly convicted by the trial court and his appeal was thus liable to be dismissed.
