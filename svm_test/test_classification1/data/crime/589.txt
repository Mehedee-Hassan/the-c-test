Iran delays Bahai espionage trial
Iran postponed yesterday the trial of seven members of the banned Bahai religion on charges of spying for arch-foe Israel, the official IRNA news agency reported.

The seven suspects had been due to go on trial before a revolutionary court on Tuesday. "Since the court received a request on Monday from the lawyers of those accused of espionage asking for more time to prepare, the court will convene at another date," the Tehran prosecutor's office said in a statement.
