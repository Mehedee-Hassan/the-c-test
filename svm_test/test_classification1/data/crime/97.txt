Saudi fire stops 'rebel boat bomb' from Yemen
The Saudi coast guard fired on an unmanned boat rigged with explosives, thwarting an attack on one of the kingdom's oil terminals that authorities yesterday blamed on Yemeni Huthi rebels.

The boat, sent from a small island off the Yemeni coast, was targeting a petroleum products distribution terminal run by Saudi oil giant Aramco when it was intercepted on Tuesday, the interior ministry said in a statement carried by the SPA state news agency.

"The boat was spotted when it departed from a small island in Yemeni waters and gained speed after entering Saudi waters," the ministry said.

After determining that the boat was unmanned, a coast guard unit opened fire on its engine and stopped it 1.5 miles (2.8 kilometres) from the terminal in the southern region of Jazan, the statement said.
