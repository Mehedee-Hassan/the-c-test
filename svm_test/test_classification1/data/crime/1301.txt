Failed candidates allege nepotism, bribery
Job seekers who failed to come out successful in the primary teacher recruitment process yesterday brought out a procession in the town and attacked Rangamati Hill District Council (RHDC) office alleging irregularities, nepotism and bribery.

They threw brickbats on the RHDC office, damaging the window panes.

Bangladesh Chhattra League (BCL) men coming from Kaptai, Baghaichhari and Longudu areas also brought out procession in the town protesting the RHDC recruitment.

The aggrieved candidates alleged that the authorities recruited several candidates in exchange of bribes. They also blamed CHT affairs minister, RHDC chairman, four councillors and some officials of RHDC for the irregularities.

Most of the appointed primary teachers are from ruling party and few general candidates got job, they alleged.

The RHDC authorities published the final result of 250 teachers including 14 head teachers on Monday night on completion of primary teacher recruitment process for the last couples of months.

BCL activists also alleged that many of their meritorious candidates including sons and daughters of dedicated leaders have been deprived of jobs.

The aggrieved candidates yesterday demanded cancellation of the appointments immediately and called for fresh and fair recruitment process.
