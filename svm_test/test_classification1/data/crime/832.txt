Murder of SP Babul’s wife: Charges framed against two accused
A Dhaka court on Tuesday framed the charges against two accused in a case filed over the killing of former superintendent of police Babul Akhter’s wife Mahmuda Khanam Mitu.

Metropolitan Sessions Judge Md Shahe Nur framed the charges, said public prosecutor Fakhruddin Chowdhury.

The court also fixed January 18 for hearing the witnesses of the case.

Earlier on November 13, the court fixed Tuesday for the charge-framing in the case.

Investigation officer of the case sub-inspector Mohim Uddin submitted a charge-sheet before the court on July 28 against arms supplier Ehtesamuluk Haque Bhola and rickshaw-puller Monir Hossain.

Bhola was arrested on June 27 while Monir arrested the following day. Police also seized the arm used for the killing of Mitu from Monir’s possession.

A case was filed with Bakalia Police Station against Bhola and Monir after the arm was recovered.

On June 5, unidentified miscreants gunned down Mitu at the port city's GEC intersection while she went there for a bus to drop her son, Mahir Akhter, 7, to Chittagong Cantonment Public School and College.
