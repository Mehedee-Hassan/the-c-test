'Formulate law to stop sexual harassment on campus'
Bangladesh Mahila Parishad (BMP) has strongly demanded formulation of a new act to implement the policy initiated by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to resist sexual harassment in higher educational institutions.

At a press conference at the National Press Club in the city yesterday Parishad President Ayesha Khanam said the existing laws are not enough to address all harassments towards women.

So, new act is required in this regard, she added.

The education ministry has reviewed the draft policy with Education Adviser Dr Hossain Zillur Rahman in the chair to finalise it, says a press release.

“The draft policy will be finalised by December 7 and it will be sent later to higher educational institutions with necessary instructions of the ministry,” said the adviser.

Parishad member Advocate Masuda Rehana Begum read out a keynote paper in which she called for creating a familial and social environment where there will be no repression against women.

She urged all to boycott perpetrators of the crime in the society, raise awareness among the young generation to resist repression, arrange sports and cultural facilities for youths, form sexual harassment resistance committees, and create cordial relations among the students, teachers and guardians.

In the wake of some recent sexual harassment incidents in the universities of Dhaka, Jahangirnagar, Rajshahi and Shahjalal Science and Technology, and some other educational institutions, the government requested the UGC to formulate a policy against sexual harassment in higher educational institutions.

Parishad General Secretary Dr Maleka Banu and Secretary for legal aid Shahana Kabir also addressed the press conference.
