Sexual harassment by teachers




I am once more prompted to write this letter (refer to my letter of September 5, 2008 on the same subject) after reading the news item captioned “Sexual Harassment at JU: Make probe report public”, published in your daily on September 17, 2008. This also has got to do with Ms. Nasrin Pervin's letter published on September 12, 2008 on sexual harassment in educational institutions. What is remarkable about the letter is, she specifically cited the name of a department and claimed that one of her close friends was the victim of her teacher's constant insistence to get into such a relationship. Thus the authenticity of her narrative cannot be disregarded.

To me, two things need to be noticed here. One that has been covertly hinted at by Ms. Pervin, and that is, not only the teachers of a particular university are engaged in such indecent behaviours with their female students, but also other public university teachers have been indulging in such practices for quite a long time. The other is, since she has mentioned an anonymous teacher of a particular department still involved in this kind of debauchery, we have every reason to believe that there exist many such teachers in other departments too, and their masks need to be uncovered immediately. In this case the Ministry of Education, University Grants Commission, our Judiciary and, above all, our parents have a strong role to play and the sooner something is done, the better for the country.
