Dr Mosharraf's son held for govt fund embezzlement
The joint forces and Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) arrested Khandaker Mahbub Hossain, son of detained former health minister Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, early yesterday in connection with a case filed for misappropriating Tk 48,51,080 from government fund, abusing power and fraud.

ACC Deputy Assistant Director (DAD) Mohammad Lutfor Rahman filed the case against Mahbub with Gulshan police on Monday night.

Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain and absconding former line director of the health ministry Dr Mahbubur Rahman have also been implicated in the case.

DAD Lutfor Rahman produced Mahbub before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court of Dhaka yesterday. After hearing, the court sent Mahbub to jail and ordered to show his father Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain arrested in the case.

According to sources, the ACC officials in cooperation with members of the joint forces arrested Mahbub at his Gulshan residence at about 3:30am and later handed him over to Gulshan police.

In the case statement, the ACC official says Mahbub misappropriated Tk 48,51,080 from a government fund in the name of supplying return tickets of Biman Bangladesh Airlines for officials of a project run by the World bank and the health ministry.

The ACC official says the accused used names of fake organisations, their fake letterhead pads, officials with fake designations and their signatures, for withdrawing the amount. Mahbub also abused power of his father, who was then the health minister, the case statement says, adding that absconding Dr Mahbubur Rahman helped Mahbub in the forgery.
