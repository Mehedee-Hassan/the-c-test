'Take steps to prevent sexual harassment of female students'
Speakers at a press conference yesterday urged the teachers to revive their image by taking steps to prevent sexual harassment of female students on the campus.

They also strongly condemned sexual abuses by a section of university teachers who are considered as the architect of the nation.

The press conference was organised by Samajik Protirodh Committee at the National Press Club in the capital.

The committee is a coordinating body of 47 non-government organisations, which has been working for establishing human rights for women since 2002.

The sexual abuse on women has risen to such extent that the female students of the universities, the highest institutions for learning, are not free from such heinous crime, said Ayesha Khanam.

It is a matter of great concern that the teachers, who are next to parents for taking care of students, are playing the role of abuser, said Dr Mahmuda Islam.

Quoting the reports of torture against women published in 14 national newspapers from January to June this year, the Protirodh Committee showed number of killing was topping the chart among the 22 types of crime against women.

A total of 402 killings occurred among 1687 incidents of violence while the number of rape was 190 taking the second position in the crime list.

Dhaka University as an independent body, it could take necessary steps to prevent such occurrences to ensure a secure environment for female students, said Executive Director of Steps Towards Development Ranjan Karmakar.

The committee placed a seven-point demand at the press conference to resist violence against female students.

Former adviser to the caretaker government Sultana Kamal was also present at the press conference.
