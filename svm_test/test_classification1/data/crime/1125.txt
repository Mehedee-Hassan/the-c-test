Indigenous people protest torching, looting of houses
Indigenous people in the district yesterday formed a human chain protesting torching and looting of houses of the community members in Ghoraghat upazila.

They also submitted a memorandum to Deputy Commissioner and Police Superintendent of Dinajpur to press home their 5-point demand.

Jatiya Adivasi Parishad [JAP] and Adivasi Samaj Unnyan Samity jointly organised the human chain in front of the DC office.

The demands include immediate arrest and exemplary punishment to the culprits involved with the 'heinous' incident on June 6, return of looted cattle, goats and other goods to the victim family members, compensation to the affected people, unconditional release of Adivasi people arrested in false case, security for villagers and steps to stop discrimination between Adivasi and Bangalee settlers.

In the memorandum, the leaders alleged that around 200 people, instigated by a local Bangalee settler, attacked houses of indigenous people at Raghunathpur, Dighipara, Bhelain and Singanala of Ghoraghat upazila on June 6 night and looted 40 cattle, 60 goats and sheep of 65 families.

Later the attackers also entered a local church. Fearing further attack, BGB and Police camps were set up in the areas.

Shanti Murmu, a victim, filed a case, accusing 50 people with Ghoraghat police station after the incidents.

Rabindranath Soren, president of Jatiya Adivasi Parishad on Monday night told this correspondent that police recovered 25 cattle. However, male family members were on the run to avoid arrest as a local influential man filed a case.

On June 6 Bangalee settlers and indigenous people of the areas in Ghoraghat upazila locked in clashes following a feud over a disputed mango orchard, leaving one person killed.
