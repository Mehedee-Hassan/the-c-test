DSE alerts all against forgery on membership
The prime bourse yesterday alerted all concerned not to deposit any money to any bank or make any deal on membership licence.

On receipt of allegation of forgery, the Dhaka Stock Exchange made such alert.

DSE said it received some letters through fax that were handwritten on forged pad of the bourse. The name of the bourse's president and his fake signatures were also used in those letters.

It described such dispatch of letters as 'completely illegal' and 'unauthorised'.

"As DSE is a limited company, it cannot sell membership licence anytime," said its president Md Shakil Rizvi.

If it plans to raise capital by selling licences, it will have to obtain approval from the DSE board meeting first and then from any extraordinary general meeting, Rizvi explained. Only then, bidding is invited through public advertisement, he further said.

"Without following these processes, no one even the government cannot sell a licence."

A faxed letter, which was sent to Munaim A Aziz of Real Options Ltd read: "As per a decision of the finance ministry, you're awarded a membership licence of the Dhaka Stock Exchange. You're requested to fulfill the necessary conditions for obtaining such membership."

"The conditions are: Clearance certificate of Tk 22.50 crore from the National Board of Revenue; clearance certificate from Anti-Corruption Commission; depositing Tk 22.50 crore against a code number of 10901-0001-2081 with Bangladesh Bank; and receiving documents of the membership licence from the Dhaka Stock Exchange after submitting money receipt," the letter read.
