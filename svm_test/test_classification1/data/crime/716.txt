The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed the Jamaat-e-Islami chief's petition for reviewing its verdict that upheld his death penalty awarded by the International Crimes Tribunal-1 in 2014.



As per the precedents set in previous executions of war crimes convicts, it is expected that after the SC's dismissal of the petition, the court will release the full text of the verdict and send it to the tribunal.The copies of the verdict will be sent to the jail authorities and the district magistrate in Dhaka.The jail authorities will then ask the condemned war criminal if he would seek presidential clemency within a "reasonable time".If Nizami, now 73, seeks mercy, his plea would go to the president through the home ministry.If he refrains from seeking clemency, the jail authorities would take preparations for his execution.
