Govt staff jailed for embezzling development fund
A Chittagong court yesterday sentenced a government staff to nine years' rigorous imprisonment for misappropriating fund from a development project.

Mamunur Rashid, an employee at the LGRD ministry who was temporarily appointed as coordinator of the project, was charged with embezzling Tk 7.17 lakh by forging the signature of the Upazila Nirbahi Officer.

The Anti-Corruption Commission lodged a case with Mirsarai Police Station accusing Mamunur of the embezzlement on June 20, 2008.

The project, Grameen Mahila Unnyan Prakalpa, was underway in Mirsarai upazila of Chittagong.
