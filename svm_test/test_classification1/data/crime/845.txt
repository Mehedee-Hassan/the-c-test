A case has been filed with Sundarganj police station in Gaibandha over the murder of ruling Awami League lawmaker Md Manjurul Islam Liton.

Tahmida Akter Kakali, sister of the lawmaker, filed the case against five unidentified people on Sunday night, said Atiur Rahman, officer-in-charge of the police station.

Police still grope for a clue to the murder.



So far, 18 people have been picked up for interrogation, with police suspecting that extremist groups might have had a part to play in the homicide.



Gunmen on Saturday evening killed the lawmaker at his village home at Sundarganj.

The murder sparked protests in the northern region of the country and three platoons of paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh were deployed at Sundarganj.



Protesters blocked roads with logs and torched spent tyres and woods to vent their anger and frustration over the killing of the sitting lawmaker.



The party activists enforced a daylong strike in the area on Sunday.
