BB digs out fraud case
The central bank has detected a case of sending a fake circular to different banks using the name of Bangladesh Bank. The central bank has alerted the banks to the fraud case.

The fake circular “directed” the banks to take the subscription fees paid to international news agency Reuters by different local news agencies, in local currency instead of foreign currency.

It also said the "chief executive officer" (CEO) of Reuters in Bangladesh and the BB entered into an agreement that the fees against the services of the international news agency should be paid in local currency.

The circular also said if the banks did not comply with the directive, action would be taken against them under anti-money laundering law.

The fake circular, issued on December 9, was sent to different banks by courier.

As the circular raised suspicion among the officials of the private banks, an official brought the matter to the notice of the central bank yesterday.

Bangladesh Bank Governor Atiur Rahman held a meeting with the high officials of the BB and directed them to take necessary steps, an official said.

SK Sur Chowdhury, executive director of the central bank, told The Daily Star that it is a "unique way" of cheating.

He said the central bank informed the banks yesterday that it was a fake circular and directed them to check with the Bangladesh Bank website if they receive any circular in future.

The central bank also informed the intelligence agencies to investigate the matter and find out who are involved with the forgery.

Contacted, an official of the Reuters Bangladesh office said the news agency does not have a CEO post in Dhaka, and there is no scope for such agreement.
