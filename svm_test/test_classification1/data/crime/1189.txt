‘Murders inspired by void of justice’
Eminent writers, scholars and cultural activists today issued a joint statement voicing frustration over failure to bring the killers of writers and free thinkers to justice.

“It appears that writers are committing worse crimes than those of the killers,” says the statement signed by thirty-six personalities.

“Killings of writers and publishers in the recent times have created a sense of fear,” it said.

The communal and militant forces are committing murders one after another, but the government could not try a single one. “These murders are inspired by a void of justice.”

“Such indifference of the government is frustrating the free thinkers. The government is failing to steer the country in a progressive direction,” the statement read.

The 36 personalities included Ahmed Rafiq, Engr Sheikh Muhammad Shahidullah, Professor Anisuzzaman, Dr Ajoy Roy, Syed Hasan Imam, Selina Hossain, Dr Muhammad Zafar Iqbal, Professor MM Akash, Professor Anu Muhammad and Kamal Lohani.

“People cannot take liability of the failures of the government and its intelligence forces. We demand immediate arrest and punishment of those involved in the killings of the writers and publishers,” the statement said.

They also labeled Section 57 as “black law” and said it contradicts fundamental rights to speech and liberty enshrined in the country’s constitution, demanding its rebuttal.
