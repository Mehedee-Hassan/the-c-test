Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday came down hard on those human rights organisations that did not raise voice against the killing of ruling Awami League lawmaker from Gaibandha-1 Manjurul Islam Liton.

‘Nowadays, we often see hue and cry when even a small incident has happened, but when an MP was killed, not even a human rights organisation or any other person uttered a single word. Bangladesh is a 'strange' country,’ she said.

The prime minister said this while addressing the senior officials of Bangladesh Police at a function on the occasion of the Police Week 2017, held at the prime minister’s office in the capital.

Inspector general of police AKM Shahidul Haque gave the welcome speech in the programme.

Home minister Asaduzzaman Khan, home secretary Kamaluddin Ahmed, DMP commissioner Asaduzzaman Mia, DIG of Chittagong range Mohammad Shafiqul Islam, additional police commissioner of DMP Md Monirul Islam, additional DIG Habibur Rahman, SP of Gazipur Harun ur Rashid spoke on the occasion. Additional IGP (Admin) Mokhlesur Rahman gave the vote of thanks.

Sheikh Hasina said that when the culprits killed people of various faiths in a planned way, carried out arson attacks on mosques and set to Holy Quran on fire, many did not raise voice against those incidents.

‘You'll have to think and remain alert about this because this is also a part of conspiracy,’ Hasina told the senior police officials.

She asked them to enhance their association and engagement with the common people in their respective areas as well as take common people into confidence to face any situation like extremism.

‘Our main strength is people as they can give information and you'll have to be associated with people and thus gain their confidence and trust,’ she added.
