Eight remanded in Yaba smuggling case
A Chittagong court yesterday placed eight persons on a two-day remand each in a Yaba smuggling case.

Mozaher, the alleged kingpin of Anwara-based Yaba syndicate, are among them, said court sources.

The court passed the order after the accused were produced before it with a seven-day remand prayer, said the prosecution.

On April 16, Rab seized 20 lakh Yaba tablets near Anwara area while those were being smuggled into Bangladesh from Myanmar by a trawler.
