Khulna Jubo League leader killed in bomb, gun attack
A union level Jubo League leader was killed in a bomb and gun attack in Khulna's Phultala upazila last night.

Deceased Jony Mollah, 30, was the vice-president of Sadar Union Jubo League, a pro-Awami League youth organisation, in the upazila.

Asaduzzaman, officer-in-charge of Phultala Police Station, said Jony was chatting to his friends in front of Tarun Sangha Club near his Dhakuria village home around 7:30pm.

Suddenly, some criminals attacked him with bombs and firing shots, leaving him injured, the OC told The Daily Star.

Jony was rushed to the upazila health complex and later shifted to Khulna Medical College Hospital where doctors pronounced him dead.

It could not be ascertained whether the victim died of bomb or bullet wounds, said Asaduzzaman.

The reason for the attack could not be known immediately, but police suspected that Jony's rivals might have carried out the attack.
