ACC grills 4 Krishi Bank officials over embezzlement
The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) today interrogated four senior officials of the state-run Bangladesh Krishi Bank for allegedly misappropriating Tk 152 crore through loan scam.

The scam took place in 2010. The officials concealed information of CIB (Credit Information Bureau) report while sanctioning the loan to Wahidur Rahman, a restaurant businessman at Dilu Road in the capital’s Moghbazar.

While availing the loan, Wahidur showed a piece of land as mortgage to the bank’s Banani branch. However, the land was earlier mortgaged to another bank for receiving other loan.

The bankers in collusion with the businessman hid the information while sanctioning and disbursing the loan of Tk 152 crore.

The four officials are: former general manager Masud Ahmed Khan, deputy general managers Golam Sarwar and Hafizuddin, and incumbent chief regional manager Zubayer Manju of Cox’s Bazar.

However, Mukther Hossain, former managing director of the bank, who was scheduled to appear, did not appear before the ACC at Segunbagicha in Dhaka today.

ACC Deputy Director Zulfikar Ali, who conducted the interrogation, said the businessman, WAhidur, remained absconding.

The anti-graft watchdog launched a probe in this regard on September 24.
