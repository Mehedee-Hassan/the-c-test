32 Islamists charged for Sept 22 vandalism
Police yesterday pressed charges against 32 leaders and activists of 12 like-minded Islamist parties including Islami Oikya Jote Secretary General Abdul Latif Nejami in a case filed for damaging and torching vehicles in the capital on September 22.

Masud Rana, sub-inspector at Shahbagh Police Station and also the case's investigation officer, submitted the charge sheet to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's (CMM) Court of Dhaka.

Names of four other leaders including Bangladesh Khelafat Andolan Ameer Maulana Shah Ahmadullah Ashraf were dropped from the charge sheet as police did not find their link with the charges.

On September 22, police filed the case with Shahbagh Police Station following clashes between the activists of the Islamist parties and law enforcers.

Twelve like-minded Islamic parties on that day fought pitched battles with police in the capital's Jatiya Press Club area to protest an anti-Islam film and a French weekly's cartoon demeaning Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).

The protesters set fire to five vehicles including a police van and vandalised more than 15 others.
