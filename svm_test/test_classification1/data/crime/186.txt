Smugglers control major spice market
Smugglers are controlling 70 percent of spice market in the country, said local spices importers.

Smugglers used at least four Bangladesh-India border points to bring these spices in the country as a result the government failed to collect around Tk 2,000 crore as revenue per year, they added.

The importers said this at a press conference, organised by Khatunganj Trade and Industries Association at Chittagong Press Club yesterday.

They urged the government to control the smuggling and decrease the tariff on spices.

General secretary of the organisation Sayed Sageer Ahmed read out a written statement at the event with its president Mahbubul Alam in the chair.

Chittagong City Corporation Commissioner Chowdhury Hasan Mohammad Hasni, former CCC councillor Jamal Hossain and other spice traders were also present.

Using the Akhaura, Chhagalnaiya, Khulna and other border points in North Bengal the smugglers brought the spices in the country, they said.
