Graft hearing: Khaleda may appear before court tomorrow
BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia may appear before a Dhaka court in Dhaka tomorrow for hearing in two corruption cases.

“There is a scheduled hearing for Zia Orphanage and Zia Charitable Trust graft cases tomorrow,” Sanaullah Mia, a counsel for Khaleda, told The Daily Star this morning.

“She (Khaleda) is respectful towards the law and is likely to appear before the court,” he said.

According to the charge sheet of the Zia Orphanage case, Khaleda, Tarique and four others embezzled Tk 2.1 crore by forming the charity that exists only on paper.

The statement of the other case say the BNP chief and three others abused power to collect Tk 6.19 crore for Zia Charitable Trust during the BNP-led government's 1991-’96tenure.

The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed both the cases.

Khaleda has been irregular in attending case proceedings. She has refrained from appearing before the court on 56 out of 63 dates for hearing in the two cases.
