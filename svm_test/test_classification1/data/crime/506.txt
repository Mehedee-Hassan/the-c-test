Bail forgery under scanner
The Supreme Court has moved to stop the lower courts being tricked into granting bail on forged High Court orders.

The move follows allegations that a number of accused have obtained bail from trial courts by producing fake HC documents, said SC sources.

Chief Justice ABM Khairul Haque has ordered an inquiry into the allegations. He has also directed the subordinate courts across the country to contact the SC registrar's office to verify HC orders before granting bail.

On the basis of probe findings, actions will be taken against the persons involved in forgery of higher court orders, added the court sources.

Earlier on January 23, the chief justice formed a five-member committee headed by SK Sinha, an Appellate Division judge, to identify the reasons behind public harassment and corruption in the judiciary.

In a circular issued on March 2, the apex court said it has noticed that accused are released on bail by subordinate courts on receipt of forged HC orders.

In the event of an HC order for bail, lower court judges must inform the deputy registrar-6 and assistant registrar-11 at the High Court Division's criminal section.

Those officials will check the authenticity of the order and let the judges know accordingly through fax or phone, read the circular signed by SC Registrar M Ashraful Islam.

The lower courts concerned, it added, will not release an accused until confirmation that the HC order is genuine.

The telephone numbers designated for deputy registrar-6 are 7171481 and 01715-058268. The assistant registrar-11 can be reached at 9562941, 9562942, 9562944 and 9567304 with extension No. 2320 and at mobile No. 01714-263326.
