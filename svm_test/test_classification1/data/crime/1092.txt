Burglary hit Paraguayans
The Paraguayan World Cup finals squad had 110,000 dollars in cash stolen from a hotel room in Evian-les-Bains where they are holding a preparatory camp ahead of next month's finals in South Africa according to a source close to the investigation.

The theft took place on Monday according to the source when the thief - said to be of Paraguayan appearance and dressed in sports attire - pretended to be a member of the Paraguayan delegation.

The man had a key to one of the rooms which he showed at the reception desk and claimed he was having trouble with the safe in that room - the staff helped him gain access, and he subsequently fled the scene after taking the money.

The investigators want to know how the thief came by the key to the room and how come he was so well-informed about what rooms the Paraguayans were staying in.
