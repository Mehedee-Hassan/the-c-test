30 fishermen kidnapped in Bay
Armed bandits said to have kidnapped 30 fishermen early today from Sonadia Channel of the Bay of Bengal.

The bandits attacked trawler FB 65 Horse Power around 3:30am and kidnapped them, our Cox’s Bazar correspondent reports quoting the trawler’s owner.

“They were bringing in their haul to Kutubdia,” Joynal Abdin, the owner said.

Local Moheshkhali Police Station concerned endorsed the incident. Its Inspector Didar Ferdaus said today that police are looking into the incident.

“A group of at least 15 bandits came on a separate trawler and attacked,” owner Joynal said quoting to fishermen – Basha Mia and Bimolendu – who jumped into the river and fled.

“The robbers have the vessel as well,” he said adding that Bangladesh Coast Guard, Bangladesh Navy and Kutubdia police were informed in this regard.

“Kutubdia police informed us because the area concerned is under Maheshkhali Police Station,” said Inspector Didar Ferdaus.

The fishermen went into the Bay on Sunday.
