HC clears all 26 convicts of murder charges
The High Court on Monday acquitted all 26 people who were earlier sentenced by the trial court for killing Abdul Latif at Araihazar in Narayanganj in 1998.

On November 24, 2009, first additional district and sessions judge sentenced five to death and 21 others to life for killing young man Abdul Latif of village Marda Sadi on September 10, 1998.

A bench of Justice Abu Bakar Siddiquee and Justice Mustafa Zaman Islam pronounced the verdict after rejecting the death reference of the five condemned convicts and allowing appeals of the 21 life-term convicts.

The death convicts were Md. Barek, Omar Ali, Md. Sohel alias Shafu, Afazuddin and Md. Showket Ali.

Of them, Omar Ali died in prison while the four are detained in jails, said the bench officials.

Of the lifers, 20 were released on bail while the rest one convict died during hearing of his appeal.

Senior lawyer Rabia Bhuiyan, who appeared for the 26 convicts, told New Age that the High Court acquitted all the convicts setting aside the trial court’s verdict as prosecution could not prove the charges against the convicts.

She said that there were flaws in the investigation as there was no eye-witness of the murder.

The High Court had also rejected the statement of one convict admitting to the murder of Abdul Latif, she said.

Deputy attorney general Moniruzzaman Rubel said that the government would appeal against the verdict.
