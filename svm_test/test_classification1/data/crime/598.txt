Cops wait for HC order copy
The police are yet to receive the High Court directives to take legal actions against a teenage drunk driver who ploughed through rickshaws injuring four people in Gulshan last week.

“We will take all necessary steps as soon as we formally receive the directives,” Deputy Commissioner (media) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) Muntasirul Islam told The Daily Star yesterday.

He said he got to know about the HC directives from the media.

“The directives will have detailed instructions and intricacies. We will take steps following them,” he added.

The High Court on Tuesday asked the police authorities to explain in two weeks why they should not be ordered to take legal actions against Fareez Rahman, the underage driver of the SUV.

The ruling came as law enforcers did not take any action in this regard.

The policemen at the scene had said Fareez, nephew of former Awami League lawmaker HBM Iqbal, was racing with another car on a waterlogged Gulshan street and had been drinking.

Giving its ruling on a Public Interest Litigation, the HC further asked why departmental proceedings should not be brought against the officer-in-charge of Gulshan Police Station for not carrying out his duty in this regard.

The October 12 incident created quite a stir on the social media, but police neither arrested Fareez, 16, nor filed any case against him.

Minutes after the accident, pictures of cops taking Fareez to Gulshan Police Station hit the social media. Police later let him go.

One of Fareez's friends gave this newspaper selfies he had taken on his mobile phone while driving. A bottle of Chivas Regal whiskey was seen in a number of those pictures.
