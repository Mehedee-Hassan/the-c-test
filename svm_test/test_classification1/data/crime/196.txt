Steps taken to stop arms smuggling from neighbouring states
Home Minister Advocate Sahara Khatun yesterday said they have taken measures to stop smuggling of illegal arms from the neighbouring countries.

“We have already ordered the law enforcement agencies to take strong steps to stop smuggling of the illegal arms,” she said while addressing the inauguration of an eye camp at Uttara in the city.

The home minister sought people's cooperation in rooting out terrorism, extremism and extortion from the country.

“Eradicating terrorism, extremism and extortion are among the main commitments of our government. But it is not possible for the administration alone,” she said.

“It will be possible when people from all walks of life will stand beside us (government),” she added.
