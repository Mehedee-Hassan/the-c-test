Chhatra Union rally demands trial of rapes, murders
Bangladesh Chhatra Union (BCU) today brought out a stick procession demanding trial of the incidents of murder and rape including the recent murder of Sohagi Jahan Tonu.

They started the rally under the banner of “Pritilota Brigade” protesting against rapists. The platform announced to train up females to learn the methods of self protection from April 8.

"The state, which pampers the rapists, will not ensure security for the females. So, there is no alternative for the females to be united and train up to protect themselves. We will inaugurate the training programme on Friday at Razu Sculpture of Dhaka University,” said BCU President Lucky Akhter.

Replying to a query, Lucky told The Daily Star, “The techniques of karate will be taught there where specialists will conduct indoor training."

Expressing dissatisfaction over the investigation process of Tonu murder case, Lucky said, "The second autopsy proved that the first one was not done properly. Moreover, evidences of the rape and murder are being destroyed. The incident is being covered up."

Meanwhile, students will observe strike along with Gonojagoron Mancha and 13 left leaning student organisations tomorrow demanding punishment of the killers of Tonu.

Bangladesh Chhatra Union will observe strike in schools and colleges on April 4 for the same demand.
