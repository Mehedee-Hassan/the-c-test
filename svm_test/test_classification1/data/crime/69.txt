The activists of Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing, Islami Chhatra Shibir, blasted several crude bombs and vandalised five shops and four vehicles in Mohammadpur and Mirpur areas of Dhaka during the second bout of its countrywide hartal today.

A man was detained from Mirpur area on charge of crude bomb blast but none was reported hurt in the incident.
