Pvt university student shot dead
A private university student was shot to death reportedly over love-related dispute at Khagan Bazar in Savar on the outskirts of the capital on Monday.

The deceased was identified as Sifat Hossain, 23, a student of Textile Department of City University hailing from Muktagachha in Mymensingh district.

Students said Shahed, a student of the Computer Engineering Department of the university, had an altercation with another student Bappi on Sunday over proposing a female student.

As a sequel of the enmity, Bappi along with his supporters swooped on Shahed while he was standing with some of his friends in front of the university gate in the afternoon.

At one stage, Bappi's supporters opened fire on the rivals, leaving two students injured.

The injured — Sifat, 23, and Basudeb, 24 — were taken to Enam Medical College Hospital where doctors declared the former dead.

On information, police rushed in and arrested two people.
