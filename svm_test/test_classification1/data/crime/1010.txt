Doctor sent to jail for torturing wife for dowry
A Dhaka court yesterday sent a doctor of Samarita Hospital to jail rejecting his bail petition in connection with a case filed for torturing his wife for dowry.

Judge AKM Ishtiaque Hussain of the District and Sessions Judge's Court passed the order after Dr Khondaker Abdul Asad along with his lawyers appeared before the court and sought bail.

Moving the bail petition, his lawyers Khondker Abdul Mannan and Abdur Rahman Howlader told the court that their client had appeared before the High Court (HC) seeking anticipatory bail on June 1.

After the hearing, Justice Sharif Uddin Chaklader directed the petitioner to surrender before the District and Sessions Judge's Court within three weeks.

In the meantime, the law enforcing agencies are directed not to harass or arrest the petitioner. The HC also in its order said the Sessions Court might consider the bail petition. Following the HC order, their client appeared before the court and sought bail, lawyers added.

On the other hand, the prosecution opposed it and said the petitioner, the prime accused in the case, had tortured the victim for dowry. So, the bail petition should be rejected and sent him to jail, prosecution added.

According to the prosecution, complainant Maksuda Khanam, a banker, in the case filed with Khilgaon Police Station on May 1 said her husband tortured her for dowry on April 15. Her husband's parents, sister and brother had also tortured her for the same, she added.

But they got bail from the court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on May 25.
