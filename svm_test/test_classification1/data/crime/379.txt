RCCI faces notice for forged voter list
The commerce ministry last week served notice on Rajshahi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) for listing members of different nonexistent and inactive business groups as voters.

The notice reached Rajshahi on Thursday and it demanded response from RCCI within seven days.

It asked why the ministry would not postpone the upcoming RCCI election on February 2 and why an administrator would not be appointed at RCCI to enquire about the enlisted fake voters.

RCCI officials said the notice was issued following complaints about fake voter list, filed by former executive members of RCCI -- Ziaul Haque, Asaduzzaman Asad and Ramjan Ali.

The ministry investigated the matter through the deputy commissioner of Rajshahi who reported some nonexistent groups became members of RCCI, such as Rajshahi Jute Traders, Wholesale Rice Traders, Cement Traders, Silk Traders, Poba and Durgapur upazila Shilpa and Banik Samity.

Abu Bakkar Ali, president of RCCI, confirmed the show cause notice and said, “We will answer in time.”
