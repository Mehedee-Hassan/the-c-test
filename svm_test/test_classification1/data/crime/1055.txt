Sexual harassment by teachers
I am writing this in response to Md Zillur Rahman and Adnan Karim's letters published in your daily on September 5, 2008 entitled 'Sexual harassment in educational institutions'.

I fully agree with Mr. Karim when he says many eminent teachers of our public universities ignoring their professional ethics calculatingly and routinely take advantage of the feelings and sentiments of quite a good number of naive girl students just to seduce them. One of my closest friends was such a victim who had to enter into a long relationship with one of the well-known teachers of English department of a famed public university at his continuous insistence. It took her two full years to find out that the teacher was a two-faced rogue who not only had such relationships with many other female students of the department in the past but also used to have so called 'affairs' with more than one person concurrently. He also had a rented flat to satisfy his amorous exploits. I must admire this friend of mine who had the guts and courage to survive the humiliation and mental shock, and is finally leading a normal life. But this does not happen to all the girls who are enticed into such relationships, and in extreme cases many even commit suicide to get rid of their disgrace. Interestingly enough, knowing it very well that my friend is now married, this teacher often shamelessly calls her to revive the relationship lying patently that he never had any other girl in his life except her.

I believe it is time our newspapers did an extensive investigative reporting on this problem or these teachers would go on doing profound harm not only to innocent female students but also to society at large.
