Cyber crime
The development in IT is wonderful. Along with these immense advantages, we are facing computer related problems like virus, hacking, e-mail spoofing, computer vandalism, pornography, money laundering and so on. They are called cyber crimes. The spread of this crime has become a matter of global concern & a challenge for the law enforcement agencies. Computer is used as an instrument to commit crime.

The criminals find it easy to destroy the evidence soon after the crime is committed. Not using the security system of computer is also responsible for it.

Cyber criminals pose a major threat to computer networks all around the world. We need to be very alert about all such developments.

To introduce people about crime & criminology, MBSTU has taken a project on different categories of crime.
