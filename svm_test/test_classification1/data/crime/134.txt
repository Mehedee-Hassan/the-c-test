Smuggling, human trafficking create border problems
Director General of Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) Maj Gen Rakibul Islam yesterday said cross border smuggling and human trafficking are the key issues that sometimes create problem in the border areas of Bangladesh and India.

"Borders of the two countries generally remain calm, but smugglers of drugs and other goods and human traffickers, who are always active across the borders, often create problem" he said at a press briefing after an informal meeting with BSF officials at zero line of India-Bangladesh border at Hili of Hakimpur upazila in Dinajpur.

He urged the civilians of the two countries to help border guards to check smuggling.

Thanking BDR and BSF for their efforts to maintain peace in the border area of Bangladesh and India, he said, "We wear different uniforms, but we are human being and it is our duty to save our motherland from any culprits."

He expressed hope that his visit to India through the border of Hili land port will help to strengthen brotherhood between the two countries.

"Last month high officials of BDR and BSF held a meeting in Kolkata on different agenda regarding the border situation. Another meeting will be held on September 22 and it will focus on maintaining peace at the border," he said.

Earlier, Umesh Kumar Nayal, DIG of Maldah BSF of India, welcomed the BDR DG as he arrived at zero line in Hili Port area yesterday afternoon.
