The International Crimes Tribunal on Tuesday said it would deliver the verdict in the war crimes cases filed against Moslem Pradhan and Syed Mohammad Hossain any day after hearing the closing argument from both the sides.

Tribunal Judge Justice Anwarul Haque kept the verdict for the announcement on a later day.

Moslem, who was in the dock and Hossain, who is still absconding both were residents Nikli of Kishoreganj.

Prosecutor Tureen Afroz submitted to the tribunal that the prosecutor have proved all the six charges against the suspects beyond reasonable doubts and sought capital punishment for the duo.

The defence lawyer, Abdus Sattar Palowan, on the other hand claimed that his client were not involved in committing crimes against humanity.

He submitted that Moslem was a farmer and Hossain was a police officer during the Liberation War in 1971.

He said that the allegations brought against his clients were baseless and expected that the court would find them innocent and they would be acquitted from the charges.

The prosecutor submitted formal charges against the duo on December 3 in 2015 and the tribunal took the charges into cognisance on January 7, 2016.

The tribunal indicted them on May 9, 2016 and their formal trial begun on June 5, 2016.

The prosecutor produced a total of 23 witnesses and the defence produced only one.
