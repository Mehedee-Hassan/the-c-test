Police today claimed that the five Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) men arrested in Dhaka were plotting sabotages on 31st night (December 31) during the New Year celebration.

Monirul Islam, chief of Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, said this while addressing a press conference at DMP media centre this afternoon.

Earlier, a team of CTTC arrested the members of the banned militant outfit during a raid at Darussalam area yesterday.

The arrestees are Md Riaz alias engineer Rakib, Md Abu Bin Sayeem alias Bappi alias Opu, Kazi Abdullah Al Osman alias Ahsan, Md Shohag alias chairman, and Md Mamun alias Himel.

“Instructed by Zia, Haider and Shahidullah of JMB’s Rajshahi unit, they’ve collected the materials for the sabotages on December 31 night,” Monirul said.

The law enforcers also seized some 30 kilogrammes of liquid and powder explosives, bomb-making materials and some books, he further said.
