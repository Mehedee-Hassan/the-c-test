Pregnant woman killed for dowry
A seven months pregnant woman was strangled by her husband at Kadamtoli of Siddhirganj upazila on Monday night as she refused to give him Tk 20,000 as dowry.

The deceased was identified as Sharmin Islam Alo, 27, wife of Imran Khan.

The killer husband fled away along with his only son Arafat Yasir after the incident.

Md Shawkat Ali, brother of Alo, said Imran had been demanding dowry from his family. They had given him around Tk 1.5 lakh as dowry since he had married Alo seven years ago.

On October 14, Imran demanded Tk 20,000 from Alo's brother-in-law, he said, adding that he killed Alo as she protested his demand for dowry from her brother-in-law.

Officer-in-Charge of Siddhirganj Police Station Mokhlesur Rahman said a case was filed with the police station in this connection.

The body of Alo was sent to the Narayanganj General Hospital morgue for an autopsy.
