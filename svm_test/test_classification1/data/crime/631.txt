Split order on Maya’s legitimacy as MP
The High Court today gave split order on Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya’s legality in holding parliament membership with a conviction in graft case.

The HC bench came up with the differing order after being moved by a writ petition challenging Maya’s legitimacy as a lawmaker and minister.

Justice Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury issued a rule asking Maya’s explanation by two weeks on under what authority he is holding the offices of minister and lawmaker.

Junior judge of the same HC bench Justice Md Ashraful Kamal rejected the writ saying that the Jatiya Sangsad speaker and election commission may decide about any dispute in this regard.

Relief and Disaster Management Minister Maya currently stands convicted in a corruption case of 2007 with 13 years jail and Tk 5 crore fine for amassing illegal wealth.

The writ petition challenging Maya’s legitimacy as MP was filed by Supreme Court lawyer Eunus Ali Akond on July 7. After verdict today, he told The Daily Star now the chief justice will forward the petition to a separate bench for disposal.

The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed the corruption case against him, also ruling Awami League leader, with Sutrapur Police Station in Dhaka on June 13, 2007.

A special court on February 14, 2008, sentenced Maya to 13 years jail and Tk 5 crore in fine for amassing illegal property. Authorities concerned were also directed to confiscate Maya’s property.

Maya appealed to the High Court against the verdict on February 14, 2008. It resulted in his acquittal before the Supreme Court scrapped that verdict on June 14 this year. The HC was told to hold further hearing in Maya’s appeal.

Eunus’ petition says, Maya cannot hold the offices of minister and parliament member as per Article 66 (2)(D) of the constitution as he is convicted in a corruption case following a Supreme Court order that scrapped his acquittal in the graft case.
