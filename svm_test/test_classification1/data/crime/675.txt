Inshallah, I am well: Salahuddin tells wife
Wife of Salahuddin, Hasina Ahmed, told the press that she got a call from the NIMHANS Mental Hospital authorities in Shillong at 12 noon today.

“I got a call from the hospital saying that my husband Salahuddin wants to talk to me. Then they connected me to him. He (Salahuddin) said ‘I am alive due to the blessings from all of you. Inshallah, I am well. I am reasonably in good health. Tell this to everybody’.”

She told the press that he did not tell her how he turned up at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences hospital.

She ruled out mistaking Salahuddin for someone else. “If I get to hear him even after 100 years, I would have no problem in identifying him, I know his voice” she said.

Wearing a pink printed saree, she appeared confident when she said, “I am trying my best to reach him as soon as possible.”

She said she needed support from all and especially from the government in getting a visa to go to India.
