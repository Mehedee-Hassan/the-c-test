An abode for stolen cattle
Twenty one cattle were recovered from an underground cowshed at the house of a suspected thief in Nilphamari's Horinchara Koimaripara village in Domar upazila on Saturday.

Law enforcers arrested Dulal Roy, son of late Kesto Mohan, in this connection.

Police said Mominul Islam, 40, son of Ansar Ali of the village along with his fellow thieves used to steal cattle from farmers' houses at dead of night. He later kept the cattle at his underground cowshed and sold them to faithful brokers and butchers at lower prices.

A few days ago, the thieves stole a milking cow from the house of one Mosharaf Hossain of Koimari village in nearby Jaldhaka upazila. The victim filed a case with Jaldhaka Police Station in this connection.

Saturday morning, he found his cow at the house of Dulal at Koimari Para after a frantic search and informed the police. Later, Dulal was arrested.

Following the arrestee's confessional statement during primary interrogation, police recovered 21 cattle from the underground cowshed where sufficient straw and grass were stored for consumption by the animals.

Mominul, however, managed to flee the scene, sensing the presence of the law enforcers, said Sub-Inspector Nazrul Islam.

Later, a case was filed with Domar Police Station in connection with the incident, said the SI.
