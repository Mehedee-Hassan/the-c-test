Thai junta passes cyber-crime law
Thailand's rubber-stamp parliament yesterday passed a controversial cyber-crime law that critics say strengthens the junta's ability to police the web and squeeze out criticism. Despite strong public criticism, the junta-appointed parliament voted to unanimously pass an updated version of the Computer Crimes Act, with 167 yes votes and five abstentions.
