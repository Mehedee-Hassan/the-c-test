3 DU students suspended for JU entry test fraud
Dhaka University has suspended three students, including two activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League, over fraudulence in university admission tests.

They are: Khalilur Rahman, a masters student of Disaster Management department, Mahfuzur Rahman Emon, third year student of math, and Owali Rahman Jony, a fresher of journalism department.

Khalil is a vice president of Jahangirnagar University, his former university, while Mahfuz is the organising secretary of Zahurul Haque Chhatra League unit.

Dhaka University Proctor AM Amzad has confirmed their suspension. “They have been suspended for giving proxy tests and fraud in admission tests.”

Jony said he sat for a proxy admission test exam into Jahangirnagar University’s Drama department under instructions from Mahfuzur Rahman Emon.

He got caught in the act during the tests held yesterday. Khalilur Rahman tried to free him from detention, said Prof ATM Shakhawat Hossain, an invigilator of the tests.

JU Proctor Prof Tapan Kumar Saha said the trio was handed over to police and a case would be filed with the Ashulia Police Station against them.
