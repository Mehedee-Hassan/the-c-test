Allegation of rawhide smuggling into India through Kurigram
Rawhides collected from sacrificial animals during Eid-ul-Azha are being smuggled to India through Fulbari border in Kurigram because of a fall in the prices of the hides this year than the last year.

With the help of so-called linemen, police and members of Border Guard Bangladesh, seasonal hide traders financed by Indian traders have been smuggling out the hides and skins to India, local people alleged.

A Bangladeshi trader, preferring not to be named, said they are more interested to sell their collected rawhides to the Indian traders as they do not get their expected prices from local tanners.

The safe routes for smuggling hides and skins are; Garakmandop, Namatari, Khalishakotal, Boshkotal, Bidyabagish Thosh, Kashiabari, Nazirhat and Uttar Anantapur Hajitari borders.

Hide smuggling continues all the year round through the routes, said Abdul Latif and Rafikul Islam, residents of Fulbari upazila along Anantapur border.

Contacted, Subedar Shahid Uddin, Kashimpur company commander of BGB-45 battalion, said stringent security measures have been taken to check such hide smuggling.
