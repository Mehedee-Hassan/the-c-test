Doctors at Birdem Hospital went on a work abstention and blocked the capital’s Shahbagh intersection for 20 minutes this morning protesting an assault on their colleagues by the relatives of a patient who died two days ago.

The unruly attendants of a patient, Sirajul Islam, physically assaulted three doctors after he died at the hospital on Sunday bringing allegation of negligence in their duties.

Protesting the attack, the doctors went on a strike around 11:10am today and formed a human chain at Shahbagh intersection, causing immense sufferings to the patients.
