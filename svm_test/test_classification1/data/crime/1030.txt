Woman tortured to death for dowry
Brutally tortured by dowry-greedy husband and in-laws, mother of a three-month-old son died at Galachipa Upazila Health Complex yesterday noon.

The victim, Rubina Begum, 22, daughter of late Abdul Jalil Sarder of Poshurbunia village under Rangabali upazila in the district, was married with Ferdous of nearby Rasulpur village three years ago, police and family sources said.

A son was born to them three months ago.

During marriage, Rubina's family gave cash and ornaments worth over Tk one lakh to Ferdous as dowry but he demanded more.

As Rubina refused to comply, Ferdous and his family members physically and mentally tortured Rubina.

On Saturday night, Ferdous tortured Rubina to unconsciousness, said Rafique Hossain, brother of the victim.

Hearing the matter, Rafique brought Rubina to Galachipa Upazila Health Complex on Monday morning and she died there.

"The patient was brought to the health complex at about 11:00am and she died after an hour when we were trying to give oxygen to her," said Dr Md Zahid Hossain, resident medical officer of the health complex.

After getting the news of Rubina's death, husband Ferdous and his family members went into hiding.

Contacted, Shishir Kumer Paul, officer in charge of Galachipa Police Station, said they sent the body to Patuakhali General Hospital morgue for autopsy.

"An unnatural death case has been filed with the police station in this regard. We will take lawful step after getting the postmortem report," he added.
