Just to check border smuggling
In a bid to check smuggling through Hili border, the authorities of the western zone of Bangladesh Railway on Tuesday cancelled stoppage of two intercity trains at Hili station.

With implementation of the decision, rail communication between Hili land port and other districts, including Joypurhat, Shantahar, Rajsahi, Natore, Parbatipur, Saidpur, Nilphamari and Khulna, has been cut-off.

Contacted, Hili station master Emdadul Islam said the authorities informed him of the matter through a letter on May 13.
