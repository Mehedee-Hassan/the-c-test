Top taxpayers in all categories to get CIP status: Muhith
Nationally recognised top taxpayers in all areas will now be awarded the Commercially Important Person status, said finance minister AMA Muhith on Monday.

‘It is interesting that those who paid the highest tax were not eligible to get the CIP status due to various reasons. Everyone who gets the national recognition should be a CIP automatically. I have taken a decision to implement it,’ he told reporters after a pre-budget meeting here last night.

Muhith said necessary proposals will be placed before the cabinet to automatically consider the highest taxpayers of all areas for the CIP status.

Members of the parliamentary standing committees on finance, planning, and public administration ministries and public accounts committee joined the meeting, held at the state guest house Padma in the city.

About the meeting's discussion, Muhith said almost all the participants talked about providing monthly payment order to at least three new educational institutions in every parliamentary constituency.

He said MPO is a continuous process, but some reforms are needed to streamline the system and underscored the need for increasing the training programmes for the teachers.

The minister also talked about the importance of decentralising the public hospitals and said the number of doctor was less than required.

Establishing costal management department and strengthening rural economy were also discussed at the meeting.
