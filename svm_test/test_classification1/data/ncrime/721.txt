Holy Family hospital doctors, employees end strike
Doctors, officers and employees of Holy Family Red Crescent Medical College Hospital in Dhaka called off their strike on Tuesday evening.

‘After getting assurance about fulfilling our demands from the authorities, we decided to end our strike in the evening’, the hospital’s officer-employees cooperative society treasurer Abu Nayeem Mohammad Saleh told

New Age.

The officers, nurses, employees and a section of physicians went on strike on Monday demanding full implementation of the eighth national

pay scale.

The hospital at Eskatan Garden Road, having about 650 beds, 126 doctors and 825 officers and employees, is one of the popular non-government hospitals in the capital.

The agitators went on movement two weeks ago after the hospital authorities lodged a case on March 2 with the Ramna police against a number of leaders of the movement for their agitation, the

agitators said.

Eighteen of the accused appeared before the chief metropolitan magistrate court on Monday, seeking interim bail and all but the hospital’s officer-employee cooperative society general secretary Md Ziaul Haque were granted bail.

Saleh said the authorities assured of legal support to release Ziaul as a hearing was scheduled for Wednesday.

The hospital director, Brigadier General (retired) Showkat Ali said the demands of the protesters were not unrealistic. ‘We want to meet their demand of eighth pay scale, but we have fund shortage… We have to raise our fund,’ he said.

Showkat welcomed the protesters for ending the strike as he said it was not the right way of negotiation, as it was a hospital meant for service to patients.
