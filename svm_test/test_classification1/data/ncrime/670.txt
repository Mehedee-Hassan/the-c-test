Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson Khaleda Zia would hold a news conference within a few days over the party’s stance on the deals and memorandums of understanding signed with India during prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s visit to New Delhi.

BNP standing committee in a meeting with Khaleda Zia in the chair at her Gulshan office Monday night made the decision, said a standing committee member.

The meeting condemned the deals and memorandums singed with India observing that those would not bring any good for the country, the meeting sources said.

The meeting that lasted for more than an hour from 9:30pm discussed next programmes to protest against the deals and build up public opinion against it.

Standing committee members including Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, Moudud Ahmed, Jamiruddin Sircar, Mahbubur Rahman, Mirza Abbas, Goyeshwar Chandra Roy and Abdul Moyeen Khan attended the meeting.
