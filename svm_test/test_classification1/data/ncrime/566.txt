US not in competition with India or China in Bangladesh: Bernicat
US ambassador in Dhaka Marcia Bernicat on Thursday said the United States is not in competition with either India or China in Bangladesh rather share the goal of a prosperous, safe, and stable society for Bangladesh.

‘I believe that all India, China, and the United States share the goal of a prosperous, safe, and stable society for Bangladesh,’ she said dispelling a notion regarding competition among the three global powers in Bangladesh.

The US ambassador said Bangladesh and its neighbours are missing out on significant opportunities because of insufficient regional connectivity.

She said Bangladesh possesses all the economic fundamentals necessary to attract foreign investment and become a regional production hub.

‘Bangladesh successes, however, would have been even greater had it been better integrated into the regional economy,’ Bernicat said mentioning positive aspects of Bangladesh that maintained more than six per cent annual growth sustained over the past two decades having a large, young, and reliable workforce.

She also found a huge domestic consumer market of over 165 million people; a vibrant, innovative private sector; and a strategic location between South Asia and Southeast Asia as positive aspects of Bangladesh.

The ambassador was addressing international conference on ‘China, India and the United States in Bangladesh: Cultivating Competitive Cooperation’ at the auditorium of Independent University, Bangladesh in the city.

IUB board of trustees chairman Rashed Chowdhury, its vice chancellor M Omar Rahman, School of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences Mahbub Alam, School of Environmental Science and Management dean IUB Md Abdul Khaleque, Independent University, Bangladesh GSG head Imtiaz A Hussain, BIMSTEC director Kunzang N Tshering, IUB adjunct professor Salehuddin Ahmed and Education, Science, Technology, and Cultural Development Trustee chairman Abdul Hai Sarker, were, among others, present.
