The Lustrous Runway in pictures
Lustrous, meaning shiny, was perhaps the most apt of adjectives to be placed fittingly in the titular position of Pond's Lustrous Runway Edition VI. The biggest fashion extravaganza of the country took place at Radisson Blu Water Garden Hotel and it raised the bar further than ever before.

The dazzling display of the latest in the fashion world enthralled a packed audience with international designers throwing down the gauntlet for the local designers. The who's who of the fashion world, starting with Sashaa Exclusives to Jyotsna Tiwari, Shamsha Hashwani, Jyoti Sachdev, Komol Sood and Rathul Sood were all present.

Intersperesed between these notable figures of the fashion world, the local designers, Rubize, Nova and others also left a lasting impression, showcasing the fact that Bangladeshi fashion was now ready to compete on a global front.

A night of glitz, glamour and grandeur, Ponds Lustrous Runway left the audience lusting for more with the night ending to racous demands for an encore from the beauty that is Diya Mirza. Night to remember? That's an understatement.
