Flashfloods play havoc in Haor belt
Standing boro rice crop on at least 2.50 lakh hectares has been inundated by flashfloods in the country’s haor belt until Thursday.

The flashfloods began a week back due to on rush of waters from the hills across the border and there was no sign that the floods would recede any time soon.

However, the incessant rains over the last seven days which also contributed to the sudden flooding stopped Thursday.

The flood level remained unchanged in the affected areas in eight north eastern districts.

The flash floods dashed boro rice growers expectation for reaping a bumper crop.

Farmers, set to harvest their boro crop from mid April, helplessly witnessed destroying their almost ripe rice crop on vast areas.

‘I had to witness helplessly for four days at a stretch as the misfortune befell me,’ said Mansur Uddin, a farmer of Satpara, Biswanath upazila, Sylhet.

His eight-acre rice field is at least two feet under waters with 300-acre crop of his neighbours.

Sunamganj has been the worst hit with 97,862 hectares of its rice fields under water, said department of agricultural extension deputy director Mamunur Rashid.

The convener of Haor Bachao Sunamganj Bachao campaign Bazlul Majid Chowdhury accused the DAE of downplaying the losses caused by the flash floods.

The executive engineer at Bangladesh Water Development Board’s Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre Sazzad Hossain found it difficult to say when the floods would recede from the haor belt.

Our Moulvibazar correspondent reported that but for providing warning that the floods could occur in two days the government did nothing to help the rice growers.

Saifur Rahman, a farmer in Moulvibazar’s Kashimpur, said he along with dozens of his neighbours worked for two days in futile efforts to save the local flood embankment.

The haor ares in Habiganj, Netrokona, Kishoreganj, Brahmanbaria and Mymensingha have also been inundated by the flash floods.
