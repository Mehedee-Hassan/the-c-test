Next CPA conference in Dhaka in November
Next annual conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association will take place in Bangladesh in early November, said CPA chairperson Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury on Tuesday.

Shirin, also speaker of Bangladesh Jatiya Sangsad, while talking with New Age said the association has finalised that next conference would take in Bangladesh like on the first week of November.

The conference was scheduled to be held in 2016 in Dhaka but it was postponed following the gruesome attack at Holey Artisan Bakery café in the capital’s Gulshan area on July 1 last year.

Shirin made the comments while attending the five day 136 Inter Parliamentary Union Assembly being held at the capital.

Commonwealth Parliamentary Association was established in 1911.
