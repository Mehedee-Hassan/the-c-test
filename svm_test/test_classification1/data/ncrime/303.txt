A book featuring photographs taken by the late cinematographer-journalist Mishuk Munier was launched at Dhaka University’s senate building on Monday.

Bengal Publication published the book titled ‘Mon Janala’, which includes photographs taken by Mishuk Munier during the installation of Aparojeyo Bangla, one of the most popular sculptures in the country located on Dhaka University campus that stands as a symbol of protest against injustice.

Sculptor Syed Abdulliah Khalid made it in 1970s.

Dhaka University vice chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique was present at the launching ceremony as the chief guest. Sculptor Syed Abdulliah Khalid, emeritus professor Anisuzzaman, Mishuk Munier’s widow Manjula Kazi, among others spoke at the programme.

They discussed on the importance of the photography book.

Mishuk Munier--who died along with four others including eminent filmmaker Tareque Masud in a road accident on August 13, 2011 at Ghior in Manikganj-- was the second son of the martyred intellectual Munier Chowdhury.

He worked for renowned local and foreign news organisations including BBC, Ekushey Television ARD1, Channel 4, CBC, and Discovery Health, ATN News, and others.

He was the cinematographer of Tareque Masud’s films.
