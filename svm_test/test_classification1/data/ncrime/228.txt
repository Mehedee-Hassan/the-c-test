Actors perform at shooting set of Basic Ali.

Popular comic strip Basic Ali featuring anomalies in society through fictional characters will be transformed into a TV series.

Creator of the cartoon Sharier Khan said the filming of the series had already begun and the first season comprising 13 episodes would be completed in May.

It will feature professional actors in different comic characters like Tawsif Mahbub as Basic Ali, Bijori Barkatullah as Molly Ali, Farhana Mili as Nila Ali.

It also features promising actors like Sabrina Mehek, Rana Abdullah, Masum Bashar and others who will enact the roles of Riya Haq, Talib Ali and Kallol Chowdhury.

It will be directed by Sayed Rinku under supervision of Sharier Khan.

‘The first series of its kind in Bangladesh will be released online and on a TV channel,’ Sharier said.

Duration of each episode may vary between 10 and 15 minutes, he said, adding that most of the episodes would feature complete stories while others would be fragments.

A perfectionist Sharier said he faced many challenges to transform the cartoon strip into a TV series in a realistic way.

‘Creating humour is always challenging. We are happy with the making of some episodes while there was room for improvements in other episodes,’ Sharier said.

‘Anyways,’ he said, ‘we expect to overcome the challenges in the upcoming seasons.’

Basic Ali comic strip has been appearing on dailies and weeklies since November 1, 2006 and it has 9 compilation books.
