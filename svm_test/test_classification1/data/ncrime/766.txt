Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday approved Tk 20 crore initial public offering of BBS Cables Limited.

BSEC gave the approval in a commission meeting presided over by its chairman M Khairul Hossain.

Under the approval, BBS will float 2 crore shares of the entity at an issue price of Tk 10 without any premium for acquiring plant and machineries, constructing building and to repay partial loans, a BSEC press release said.

As per the entity’s financial statement for the year ending on 30 June, 2016, earnings per share and net asset value per share was Tk 2.46 and Tk 16.87 respectively.

The market regulator also approved Tk 500 crore subordinated bond of Dutch Bangla Bank Limited that would be redeemable in seven years.

Commercial bank, non-bank financial institutions, insurance company, corporate house and high net worth individuals would only be allowed to subscribe the bond. The face value per unit of bond will be Tk 1 crore.

BSEC, meanwhile, fined directors of three over-the-counter market companies—Aman Sea Food Industries Limited, Rose Heaven Ball Pen Industries, ChicTex Limited — Tk 1 lakh each for the entities’ failure to submit annual report for the year that ended on June 30, 2015.

Independent directors of the companies, however, were excluded from the penalty.
