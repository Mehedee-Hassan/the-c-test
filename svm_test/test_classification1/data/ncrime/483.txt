Grand Master Enamul Hossain Rajib emerged the champion in the 35th National Chess Championship beating veteran GM Niaz Morshed in the last round game of the tournament on Tuesday.

Before the last round of the 13-round tournament both Rajib and GM Abdullah Al Rakib were on top with 10 points but the latter could salvage only a draw against Fide Master Reazul Haq meaning the win was enough for Rajib to achieve the glory.

It was Rajib’s third national championship, first since 2006.

Rajib, who played with black pieces, overcame some great challenge offered by the most experience opponent Niaz and ensured his win after 49th move.

‘It was a great feeling of winning title after beating such an opponent like Niaz bhai,’ Rajib told New Age.

‘Honestly speaking I feel no pressure before the game because I thought Rakib would win the title because he got comparatively easier opponent than me.

‘It also helped me to play pressure-less game and when Rakib ended his game with a draw that time I was in better position.’

Rajib won nine games and drew four to win the title.

‘Actually I enjoyed the game from the beginning of the competition and

my confidence boosted

after performing better in the last Chess Olympiad where I played in the number one board against some toughest players of the world.’

Niaz admitted that a single mistake brought the defeat for him.

‘I played a wrong move of queen which gave Rajib more space to put me under pressure,’ said Niaz.
