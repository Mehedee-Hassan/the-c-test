Mohiuddin Chy slams Ctg mayor
ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, president of ruling Awami League’s Chittagong city unit, came down heavily on the city mayor, AJM Nasir Uddin, at a Laldighi Maidan rally on Monday afternoon.

The former mayor, Mohiuddin Chowdhury, complained that Nasir Uddin, the general secretary of Chittagong city Awami League, ‘failed to perform his duty as a mayor.’

He was not paying attention to his duties and remained busy with his businesses at the Chittagong port, Mohiuddin alleged.

Mohiuddin also complained that AJM Nasir Uddin killed at least 12

people in different times. ‘He (Nasir) can kill a person with a smile on his face.’

‘Behave yourself. People are annoyed with you for your activities and

behaviour,’ said Mohiuddin.

Sonali Jantrik Matshya Samabay Samiti organised the rally protesting at some recent decisions made by CCC, including increasing trade licence and holding tax fee and relocation of Fishery Ghat fish warehouses.

‘You are doing injustice to 50 lakh city people by increasing holding tax, but you are not doing works for the city,’ he retorted.
