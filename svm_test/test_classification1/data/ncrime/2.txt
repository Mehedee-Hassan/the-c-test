Disclose all deals with India, BNP asks govt
Bangladesh Nationalist Party on Monday asked the government to disclose all deals signed with India during prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s recent visit to the neighbouring country.

‘It is clearly stated in the constitution that if the government sign any agreement with foreign countries, it must be placed before parliament,’ said BNP’s senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi in a press conference in the party’s central office in Dhaka.

Rizvi said the present Awami League government signed made many agreements with India, but none of those was placed before parliament.

It was a clear violation of the constitution, he added.

The BNP leader also claimed that the deals were signed defying public opinion.

He said the government kept people in dark about the deals to realise its ill purposes.

Independence and sovereignty of Bangladesh were compromised in the deals, he added.

He said BNP would not compromise the country’s independence and sovereignty.

Rizvi said people started speculating that the prime minister weakened Bangladesh’s security system for her own interest.

She even failed to start a discussion on Teesta deal, he lamented.

Asked whether BNP would scrap the deals with India, he said no popular government could make such anti-national agreements or deals.
