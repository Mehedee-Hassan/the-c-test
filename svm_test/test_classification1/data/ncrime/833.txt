Celebrities share thoughts on Daily Star!
The Daily Star has turned 26. Like many others in the cultural fraternity, magician Jewel Aich is fulsome in his praise for the newspaper. As he says:

“My relationship with The Daily Star goes beyond 26 years, and its editor has been like a brother to us for many years. Since then I have always known that whatever he does, it is always with utmost sincerity. The Daily Star has grown from its humble beginnings to become a leading English daily. Now it has such a sound reputation that people are sure about the authenticity of its coverage. And if they have made any mistakes, they are always quick to be honest about it and acknowledge it – this is something that did not exist in journalism in our country before.”
