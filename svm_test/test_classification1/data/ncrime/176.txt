Poldark bath scene named best TV moment of 2016
A steamy bath scene from the second series of Poldark has topped a poll of the biggest television moments of 2016.

RadioTimes.com voted for the scene from the Cornwall-set drama, where Ross Poldark - played by Aidan Turner - is bathed by wife Demelza, portrayed by Eleanor Tomlinson, reports BBC.

Turner takes the prize for a second year running, following his topless scything scene from series one in 2015.

More than 2,000 people took part in the online poll.

They were asked to choose from a shortlist of 35 clips said to be among the most dramatic, inspiring and emotional TV moments of the year.

The moment in Peaky Blinders when the Shelbys were arrested was voted the second biggest moment of the past 12 months, followed by Tom Hiddleston’s brief flash of nudity in the Night Manager.
