Noted Bangladeshi poet Tarik Sujat was honoured with the Prothom Alo Award by Indian fortnightly Prothom Alo at the ongoing International Kolkata Book Fair on Saturday.

A Kolkata-based writer Ranjan Bandyopadhyay also received the award, said a press release.

The awards were handed over by Satyam Roy Chowdhury, chairman of Techno India and Aajkaal Media Group. Publishers and Booksellers Guild general secretary Tridib Kumar Chatterjee and Prothom Alo editor Bithi Chatterjee were also present at the programme.



Tarik’s poetry has superbly documented pains, agonies, weal and woe of human beings, historical and political episodes in the country.

His poems are distinguished for their highly expressive and communicative, poignant and symbolic traits.

For inspiration, Tarik veers towards human life and their varied social and cultural aspects, patriotism, political ups and downs.



Tarik Sujat, who is at present the general secretary of National Poetry Council, earlier won the Krittibas award in India in 2006.

He also won two international awards for Graphic Design.

Some of the famous poetry collections published under his name include Protibimbo Bhenge Jao (1986), Jabo Bole Theme Thakte Nei (1997), Shomoyke Ami Ulto Paa-E Hete Jete Dekhechi (2003), Akaspuran (2009) and Kabitasangraha (2013).

He has also edited the late poet Abul Hasan’s story collection and dance drama Ora Koyekjon.
