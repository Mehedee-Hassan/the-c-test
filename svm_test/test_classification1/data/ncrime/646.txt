The minister for road transport and bridges, Obaidul Quader, on Saturday said that Bangladesh Nationalist Party is now looking to the United States election for succor, after becoming frustrated with India.



‘BNP has failed to play effective role as opposition. Now they are frustrated. They are frustrated with India. Now they are looking to the US election. BNP has no confidence in the people. But the main strength of Sheikh Hasina is the people of the country,’ Quader said.

About the council, the ruling party leader said now Awami League has no overt enemies. But the party has covert enemies and urged the leaders and activists to remain alert so that the covert enemies don’t create chaotic situation during the council.
