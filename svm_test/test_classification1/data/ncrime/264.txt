Dancers of a Chittagong-based troupe entertained the audience by presenting classical odissi dance at a two-day festival organised at National Theatre Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy on Saturday and Sunday.

Chittagong-based troupe Odissi and Tagore Dance Movement Centre celebrated its 16th founding anniversary through the event.

On Sunday, the concluding day of the festival, dancers entertained the audience by presenting a dance production titled ‘Bashori o Turja Haate Kobi’ – a compilation of Kazi Nazrul Islam’s songs on love and nature.

The festival commenced on Saturday with presentation of Odissi dance by the members of the organisation. Different features of odissi dance like foot tapping, spinning and others were demonstrated by the dancers.

A performance of Mangalacharan Shiv Bandana, a devotional dance to Hindu god Shiva, followed.

Dancers presented different sequences of odissi dance like Mokkho, Saveri Pallavi, Yugdanda Pallavi, Aarvi Pallavi, Batu and others much to the delight of the audience.

A dance recital synchronised with Tagore song Aji Dokhino Pabone was a major attraction of the event.

The inauguration day’s programme also included a discussion session and felicitation programme. Among others, cultural personality Kamal Lohani, Kolkata-based dancer Poushali Mukherjee and director of Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre Jayasree Kunda were present on the occasion.

Odissi and Tagore Dance Movement Centre honoured noted dancers Minu Haque, Amanul Haque, Saju Ahmed, Sharmila Banarjee, Munmun Ahmed and Tamanna Rahman at the event.

Director of the organisation, Abonty Mujherjee said the dance organisation normally celebrates its founding anniversary in Chittagong but this year it organised the programme in Dhaka to reach new audience.
