Bangladesh Physically Challenged Cricket Team clinched a commanding 170-run victory against Sri Lanka to make a flying start at tri-nation tournament that got underway in Dhaka on Sunday.

At Jagannath Hall playground on Dhaka University campus, Bangladesh’s Shaharia Shamim played the pivotal role for the win as his whirlwind 78 off just 35 balls helped them score 218-8 in 20 overs.

In reply, Sri Lanka were bundled out for just 48 in 16.1 overs.

Shaharia hit 11 fours and four sixes and got good support from Sujon Devnath, who made 54 helping the home side to get a decent score after they lost first four wickets within first six overs.

Dinesh Kumara was the pick of the bowlers for Sri Lanka with 2-27.

Sri Lanka stumbled from the beginning as hosts’ bowler Mozammel Haque grabbed 3-9 while Amin Uddin and Suzaul Islam got two wickets apiece to fold them cheaply.

India, the third team of the tournament, will take on Sri Lanka today before they face Bangladesh on Tuesday at the same venue.

The final of the tournament will take place on April 20.

Sate Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs Biren Sikder inaugurated the tournament before the match on Sunday.
