Muhith mulls ‘fat tax’ on junk food
Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith on Tuesday said that he would look into the possibilities of imposing 14.5 per cent ‘fat tax’ on junk food, while preparing upcoming budget for 2017-18 fiscal year.

The junk food and fast food are gaining a lot of response from the countrymen as it is cheap but these foods are unhealthy, Muhith said while replying a call attention notice of lawmaker Nujahan Begum.

‘It is good idea, I myself never had thought about imposing tax on junk food. I will look into the matter while preparing next budget,’ Muhith said.

‘For next one or two months we will have to prepare a list of the junk and fast food in order to impose such tax,’ he added.

Nurjahan Begum demanded imposing of 14.5 per cent fat tax on junk food holding the food responsible for increasing obesity and terming it unhealthy.

Food habits are changing fast and many people taking junk and fast food risking their health hazard, including increasing risk of non communicable diseases, she said.

Fat tax can be imposed on different types of beverage, packet foods, saturated fat contained foods, potato chips, chocolates, pizza, burger and others, she said.

If the price of these food increases, consumption of these foods will decrease, she added.

Government can spend the money collected from the tax for development of the health sector, Nurjahan proposed.

Many countries including India and Hungary had imposed fat tax, she said, adding that Indian state Kerala’s government has proposed a 14.5 per cent 'fat tax' on burgers, pizzas, and other junk foods recently.

In July, Kerala introduced a fat tax on burgers, pizzas, doughnuts and tacos served in branded restaurants, aiming at making people more conscious about food choices and curbing obesity.
