A Kolkata-based dance troupe entertained the audience with a presentation of Gaudiya Nritya at the National Theatre Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy on Monday.

The programme was organised by Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre.

The 13-member team of Gaudiya Nritya Bharati, led by dancer-cum-researcher Mohua Mukherjee, demonstrated different styles of Gaudiya dance, which advocates claim to be the ninth classical dance form of India and the only form to represent Bengal.

Like most other classical dance genres, Gaudiya – alternatively spelled Gauriya – also begins by seeking blessings from the Hindu gods and goddesses, and Monday’s show was no exception.

The opening performance was by the female members of the troupe, who presented Chandi Bandana, in which they sought blessings from Chandi, a Hindu goddess believed to be the combined form of Lakshmi, Saraswati and Durga.

The next performance was Ardhanariswar, a dance piece rejoicing the eternal bond between men and women, presented by two dancers of Gaudiya Nritya Bharati.

The evening’s main attraction, however, was a solo performance by Mahua Mukherjee who demonstrated different features of the Gaudiya dance.

The troupe’s last presentation was Das Aavtar, a colourful and lengthier piece in which tribute was paid to 10 Hindu gods – Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, Balarama, and Kalki, who descended to Earth in different times to guide the human race.

While talking to New Age, Mahua Mukherjee said that Gaudiya has already been recognised as a classical dance genre by the Indian government which has been granting scholarships to the enthusiasts since 1996.

‘Besides, our government has commissioned two documentary films on Gaudiya,’ she added.
