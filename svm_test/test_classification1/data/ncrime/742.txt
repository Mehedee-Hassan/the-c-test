Awami League has cancelled its plan to accord reception to prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on her return home from India on Monday evening, said a party statement on Sunday evening.

‘We have cancelled the plan to accord reception to prime minister Sheikh Hasina on her return home after a successful visit to India, on the decision of the prime minister,’ said the statement signed by AL office secretary Abdus Sobhan Golap.
