Moon Rahman, who didn’t have any formal training on art, explores her surroundings and human facial expressions in her second solo underway at Kalakendra in Mohammadpur.

The exhibition titled ‘Face to Face’ features 19 untitled paintings, mostly acrylic on canvas and paper, by the artist.

The displayed works depict faces of individuals she came across in her surroundings and everyday life in different colours and shades. Her depiction of facial expressions narrates various stories of life and also explores mentality of different persons.

Some of the faces appear dreadful as she investigates the true identity of the complex and uncanny individual hiding behind a face.

One of her displayed paintings show a smiling face with large eyes and teeth and its head is full of hairs resembling mushrooms. It is difficult to say whether the face is of male or female.

A large rectangular painting in blood red colour depicts busy city life showing miniature humans surrounded by busses, cars, rickshaws and more.

‘Moon Rahman, who is a housewife and mother of two children, has no academic background in art but she paints for her passion. But, we found her works interesting and gave her a platform by organising a solo show in 2015,’ said artist Wakilur Rahman, who is the curator of the show.

The exhibition that began on April 1 will remain open till April 24.
