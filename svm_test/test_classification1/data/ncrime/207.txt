Combining shadow play, installation art and mime show, Dhaka University Mime Action staged Kalo Raat, a twenty-minute experimental play depicting the March 25 genocide, on Saturday at Nandan Mancha of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy.

Directed by Mir Lokman, Kalo Raat began with a shadow play performance by artistes of Dhaka University Mime Action depicting the historic March 7 speech of the founding

president of Bangladesh Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the black night

of March 25 when the Pakistani army carried out genocide against the Bangalee people.

The troupe displayed the catastrophes of Pakistan army’s genocide by showing a pile of blood-stained bodies using installation art.

In the last segment the troupe’s artistes, through mime performance, depicted how the people united against the Pakistani army and fought bravely for freedom.

‘Kalo Raat is an experimental production in which we have combined two theatre forms and an art form to narrate a historic event’, Mir Lokman, director of the production, told New Age.

Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy organised the show.
