China has shown interests to sign memorandum of understanding with Bangladesh Police to strengthen its capacity, said inspector general of police AKM Shahidul Hoque on Monday.

Shahidul said during a bilateral meeting with Chinese delegation to the police chiefs’ conference, China showed the interest. Bangladesh police told the Chinese delegation that necessary steps in this regard would be taken after consulting the government.

In another bilateral meeting with the deputy chief of Myanmar border police, Shahidul requested Myanmar to demolish factories of contraband drugs such as yaba along Bangladesh-Myanmar frontier.

The inspector general said Bangladesh also requested Malaysian police to find out ways to reduce harassment of Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia.
