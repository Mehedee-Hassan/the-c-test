Mabia Akter Simanta

Bangladesh Weightlifting Federation on Saturday announced monthly cash reward for Mabia Akter Simanta for her outstanding performance throughout the year.

Simanta became the best weightlifter of the country after setting new national records in 63-kg category of the recently concluded National Weightlifting Championship.

As a result, BWF with the assistance of RAK Group, decided to reward Simanta a salary of Tk 15,000 per month.

Simanta set three different national records in snatch, clean & jerk that helped the 2016 South Asian Games gold medallist to impress the high-ups of the federation.

Federation president major general Abul Hossain, who is also the director general of the Border Guard Bangladesh, handed over the cheque and crest to Simanta in presence of RAK Group vice-president Mohammad Riazuddin and federation general secretary Narayan Chandra Debnath.

This is for the first time that Simanta received a permanent financial support from the federation after receiving Tk one lakh as bonus money for his gold medal in the SA Games.

‘I’m really happy with the initiative of federation,’ said Simanta.

‘Such an initiative will encourage the lifters to do better in future.’

Simanta, who is now preparing for the upcoming Islamic Solidarity Games, scheduled in Baku, Azerbaijan, from May 8 to 22, believed this will inspire her to perform well in Baku.

In the programme, the federation also honoured some veteran officials for their huge contribution in the game.

A total of 13 officials, both living and posthumous categories, were awarded crests from the federation president while a host of officials of current committee also received honours from the president for their contribution in the last National Championship.

Federation president also announced Tk one lakh for the gold medallists of the National Championship.
