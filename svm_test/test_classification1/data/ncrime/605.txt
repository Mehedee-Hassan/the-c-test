WHO to continue help Bangladesh combat three major diseases
The World Health Organisation on Wednesday assured of continuing its assistance in Bangladesh to eliminate three major diseases — HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria — from the country.



The assurance came when WHO regional director for Southeast Asia Poonam Khetrapal Singh paid a courtesy call on prime minister Sheikh Hasina at Ganabhaban in Dhaka this morning.



After the meeting, PM's deputy press secretary Md Nazrul Islam briefed reporters.



He said the WHO regional director highly praised Bangladesh's health

sector development, particularly establishment of community clinics, under the leadership of prime minister Sheikh Hasina.



‘Setting up of community clinics in Bangladesh for the grassroots people is a very fruitful programme, and wherever I go, I highlight the programme as an example,’ she said.



Poonam also said the World Health Organisation is encouraging other countries to replicate this programme to reach healthcare services at the people's doorsteps.



The WHO regional director apprised the prime minister of the preparation for the International Conference on Autism and Neurodevelopment Disorder to be held in Bhutan next month.



Bangladesh, Bhutan, and the WHO are jointly organising the three-day

conference in Bhutan from April 19-21.



Poonam also informed the prime minister that the WHO will arrange an

international conference on autism in Dhaka this year or next year to create awareness about autism.

She highly lauded Saima Wazed Hossain, the chairperson of the National Advisory Committee on Autism in Bangladesh and daughter of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, for her role in autism issue.



‘The WHO has included autism in its programme because of Saima Wazed,’ she said.



The prime minister said her government has been working tirelessly to ensure basic needs of the people including food, healthcare, education, clothes, and housing.
