The prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, on Sunday reaffirmed that Bangladesh’s soil will not be allowed to be used by any extremist group for carrying out insurgent activities in neighbouring countries.

‘Our major tasks are to fight poverty and terrorism. The soil of Bangladesh won’t be allowed to be used by any terrorist group to carry out insurgent acts in any neighbouring country. We’re maintaining it strongly,’ she said when Indian army chief general Bipin Rawat met her at Ganabahban.

PM's press secretary Ihsanul Karim briefed reports after the meeting.

Prime minister thanked the Indian Army chief for visiting Bangladesh and recalled the contributions of India, its people and the army during Bangladesh’s Liberation War.

Sheikh Hasina said the main task of the present government is to improve the fate of the country’s people. ‘We’re working restlessly on that.’

She also said India could help Bangladesh by giving training to its people on nuclear power plant.

General Bipin highly appreciated Bangladesh’s development and said India value the friendship with Bangladesh and deal everything standing on an equal status. ‘Size does not matter here, we all are equal,’ he said.

Both countries could move forward through the continuation of cooperation, he said adding that they are very happy to see a stable Bangladesh under Sheikh Hasina’s leadership.
