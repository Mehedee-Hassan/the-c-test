Peers greet Shamsul Wares at a programme on Saturday at Dhaka Club.

Art critic and architect Shamsul Wares was honoured on his 71st birth anniversary celebrated at the Dhaka Club on Saturday.

Senior architects, artists, diplomats, social and cultural activists, journalists, thespians, gallerists and others attended the event and greeted him with flowers and gifts.

The programme was organised by Architects Limited.

Shamsul Wares is a former professor of architecture at the Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology. Introvert by nature, he became an outspoken liberal intellectual in the 1990s against reactionary nationalism and religious fundamentalism in Bangladesh.

Shamsul is also one of the foremost architects of the ‘70s, an era marked by accomplishments and revolutionary ideas. He is considered a modern architect with regards to content, material, form and shape.

He also served as juror and speaker in many seminars, art and architecture exhibitions, competitions, architecture biennials and triennials in the country and abroad.

He frequently writes for the artists' brochures, art and architecture journals and creative publications.

He was also featured in the documentary ‘My Architect: A Son's Journey,’ based on Louis I Kahn.
