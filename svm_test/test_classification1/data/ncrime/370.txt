Mangal Shobhajatra to be organised countrywide
The minister for cultural affairs Asaduzzaman Noor on Monday said Mangal Shobhajatra, a procession during Bengali New Year celebrations which has been recently inscribed on UNESCO's Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, will be organised across the country.

He said it in an inter-ministerial meeting held at the seminar room of the Bangladesh Shilapkala Academy where representatives from home ministry, woman and children affairs ministry and Shilpakala Academy were present.

‘Mangal Shobhajatra and celebration of Nababarsha is organised in the city. But from now, these will be organised in the district, upazila and union level to reach the root level with ideal of militant free Bangladesh,’ said Asaduzzaman Noor.

Charupath, a Jessore-based cultural organisation, first organised the Mangal Shobhajatra with some puppets and colorful masks to observe the Nababarsha.

Then some fine arts students of Dhaka University organised the Mangal Shobhajatra in 1989.

The decision of inscribing Mangal Shobhajatra on UNESCO'S Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity was taken on November 30, 2016 at the 11th session of the intergovernmental committee on intangible cultural heritage, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
