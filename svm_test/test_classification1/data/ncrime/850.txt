Mystic legendary Pagla Kanai's 207th birth anniversary observed
The 207th birth anniversary of legendary mystic bard Pagla Kanai is being observed at Pagla Kanai complex. The programme has been arranged by 'Pagla Kanai Smriti Shangrakkhan Shangshad'( PKSSS) of Berbari village, Jhenidah. The anniversary programme will run from March 9-11.

On Thursday noon Jhenidah Deputy Commissioner (DC) Md. Mahbub Alam Talukdar inaugurated the anniversary. Jhenidah local government Assistant Secretary Abu Yousuf Md. Rezaur Rahman was present as special guest. The meeting was chaired by PKSSS secretary Abdur Rashid.

Kanai became renowned for his folk songs. He composed a large number of devotional songs but many of these have not been preserved.

Pagla Kanai's intense spirituality was evident at an early age, hence the locals started calling him “pagla”.

Kanai's spiritual inclination brought him in touch with the bauls and fakirs of the area.

People from all walks of life used to throng his 'ashor' (performance) and listen to his songs for hours. Gradually he earned a following throughout the country.

Pagla Kanai's songs can be classified into “jari” “dhua” “palagaan” “kobigaan” “murshidi” “marfati “ and more.

Scholars such as Mohammad Mansur Uddin , Dr. Mazharul Islam, Abu Talib, Amin Uddin Shah, Durga Das Lahiri and Upendranath Bhattacharya collected Pagla Kanai's songs and conducted research on the bard.
