Many institutional Investors started booking profits from the previous week’s gain after the key index of the bourse neared the psychological mark of 5,800 points, they said.

The fall in share prices of bank and non-bank financial institutions played a vital role in dragging the market down.

Bank and NBFI slumped by 5.67 per cent and by 1.56 per cent respectively.
