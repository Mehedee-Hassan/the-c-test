Ex-DCC ward commissioner held in city
Police arrested Shamim Parvez, a former Bangladesh National Party ward commissioner of undivided Dhaka city corporation, on Wednesday night from the city’s Paribagh area.



Mirpur police station sub-inspector Rasheduzzaman Beg said they arrested Shamim from a house at Paribagh around 11:00pm.



He, however, declined to give further details.



Shamim faces at least 15 criminal cases, mostly related to street violence.



Meanwhile, BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir strongly protested and condemned Shamim’s arrest.



In a statement, he alleged the government is repressing BNP leaders and activists in ‘false and peculiar’ cases as part of its move to give the ‘one-party rule’ a permanent shape.



He alleged that the government has created a terrible situation across the country by arresting their party leaders and activists.



Fakhrul said the country’s people will foil the government’s efforts to restore one-party rule braving its repressive acts.



In another statement, BNP’s Dhaka city unit convener Mirza Abbas also condemned the arrest.



Both Fakhrul and Abbas demanded the government immediately release Shamim withdrawing all the ‘false’ cases filed against him.
