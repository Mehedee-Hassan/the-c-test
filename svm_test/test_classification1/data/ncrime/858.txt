Prachyanat's “Laljatra” today
To observe the dark night of March 25, 1971 when the Pakistani occupation army cracked down on Dhaka and launched one of the most heinous genocides in this part of the world, Prachyanat School of Acting and Design is bringing out out a unique procession. Titled “Laljatra”, the procession will start from Soparjito Swadhinota Chattar at TSC, Dhaka University at 5pm and circle back from Fuller Road, in commemoration of the lives lost on that fateful night.

This procession has been a regular annual event by Prachyanat, a moving tribute to all the lives lost in the genocide on that night, of which Dhaka University itself was a crucial part of. In past years, the procession has included a long piece of red fabric to symbolize the bloodshed, with members of Prachyanat playing musical instruments and singing along. The event was conceptualized by musician-thespian Rahul Anand, who will lead this year's procession as well.
