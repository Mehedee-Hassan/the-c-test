ACC to hold countrywide human chains Friday
The Anti Corruption Commission will organise a countrywide human chain progamme on Friday, aiming to raise a united voice against corruption.

About 2.5 lakh students of the country’s 22,000 educational intuitions are expected to join the human chain programme to create a social movement against graft across the country.

The human chain, which will be formed in the capital, will stretch from Uttara to Jatiya Press Club via Farmgate, Shahbagh and Bijoynagar from 10:00am to 11:00am, ACC spokesman Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya told the news agency.

Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid, ACC chairman Iqbal Mahmood, its commissioners Nasir Uddin Ahmed and AFM Aminul Islam and ACC senior officials will take part in the event.

Noting that the human chain will demonstrate the ACC’s firm stance against corruption, Iqbal Mahmood urged all, including students, teachers, government officials, public representatives, media and civil society members, to join the programme.
