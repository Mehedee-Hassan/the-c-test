Dhallywood superstar Shakib Khan, his wife actress Opu Biswas and their son Abraham Khan Joy celebrated Pahela Baishakh at a five-star hotel in the capital on Friday.

It was their first public appearance together after a week of their real-life drama over their secret marriage in 2008 and having a son.

Earlier, Opu along with Joy went to meet Shakib at a hospital on Thursday where the hero was admitted being over stressed following a series of controversies regarding their marriage news made public by Opu on a private TV channel on Monday.

Opu in the interview said she decided to make their marriage news public being disturbed by the news that Shakib would pair up with Shabnam Bubli in Shamim Ahmed Rony’s upcoming film Rangbaj in the Eid ul Fitr.

The maharat (formal announcement) of the film was also organised on Friday evening at a hotel where Shakib and Bubli were present.

Shakib at the event refused to take any question regarding his personal life and said that he wanted to look forward.

‘Personal life should not be an issue in professional career,’ Shakib said.

Bubli also remained silence on Shakib-Opu relation, though she also became a part of gossips as Opu reacted to Shakib-Bubli on screen chemistry.

Bubli, however, wished all the best for Opu on Wednesday and said she should not be a part of any controversy regarding the personal life of Shakib Khan and Opu Biswas.
