The cabinet on Monday gave final approval to the draft of the Rajshahi Development Authority Act, 2017 incorporating a master plan to develop the city as a planned one and a provision of jail or fine for filling water reservoir, low land, cutting hills or hillocks and stopping water flow.

The approval was given at the regular weekly meeting of the cabinet held at the Bangladesh Secretariat with prime minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair.

After the meeting, cabinet secretary Mohammad Shafiul Alam briefed reporters.

He said the original law was the Rajshahi Town Development Ordinance Authority 1976 promulgated by the martial law regime and it was translated into Bangla and updated as per earlier directives of the Supreme Court that had declared all marshal law ordinances illegal.

The cabinet secretary said according to the draft law, Rajshahi city would be developed under a master plan and anyone using lands of the city violating the master plan will have to face jail or fine or both the punishments.
