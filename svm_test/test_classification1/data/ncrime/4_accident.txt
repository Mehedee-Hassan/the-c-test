4 killed in Saudi fire
A fire killed at least four Bangladeshi workers in Nazran city in Saudi Arabia on Monday.

The dead are Khorshed Alam, 27, son of Abdul Gani, Kamal Hossain, 25, son of Rashid Fakir, Mojnu Mia, 26, son of Lalu Mia of Safibad village, and Mokbul Hossain, 40, son of Hafiz Uddin of Koa village in Kachua upazila.

Family members say the dead were working as construction workers in Nazran and used to share a room.

On the day of the incident they sprayed some chemicals in their room against bugs.

The fire broke out when one of them thrown a matchstick on the floor after burning cigarettes.

The fire first caught Mokbul and soon engulfed the entire room, leaving all of them dead on the spot, witnesses said.

Sources say the dead were close relatives. Mokbul had been an expatriate in Saudi Arabia for 11 years and took the three from Safibad village three years ago.

Preparations to bring the bodies, preserved in the mortuary of Nazran Hospital, are underway.

Foreign Minister Dipu Moni expressed her condolences over the deaths and conveyed sympathy to the bereaved family members, said a ministry press release.
