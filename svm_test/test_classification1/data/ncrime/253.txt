Rabirashmi, an organisation of Tagore singers, organised the show titled ‘Boilo Praney Dakhin Hawa’, as part of its regular tri-monthly event.

‘The season of spring is nearing its end. Through Tagore’s songs on the season we wish to celebrate the spring,’ Mohadev Ghosh, noted Tagore singer and Rabirashmi director, told New Age.

‘Tagore composed songs celebrating beauty of all six seasons but he composed the majourity of them on spring’, Ghosh added.

The programme commenced with chorus of Tagore’s - Dakhin Hawa Jago Jago and Bishwabinarobe Bishwajan Mohichhe by artistes of Rabirashmi.

This was followed by a solo performance by singer Farmina Islam Ema, who presented Tagore’s popular song Ektuku Chhoya Lagey at the show.

Dipti Chowdhury’s rendition of popular Tagore song Aj Jotsna Ratey won much praise from the audience.

Among others, Maksuda Khanam Tuli, Parmina William, Sharmin Akhter, Rajib Ferdous and Dilip Kumar Das presented songs at the show.
