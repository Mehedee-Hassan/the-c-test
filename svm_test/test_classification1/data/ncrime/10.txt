The minister for education Nurul Islam Nahid on Saturday said the government will stop the admission of new students to those private universities that have failed to set up their own campuses.

‘We'll stop the admission of new students to those universities which couldn't yet set up their own campuses,’ he said while addressing the 4th convocation of United International University in the capital.

Professor Jamilur Reza Choudhury, University Grants Commission chairman Abdul Mannan, UIU vice-chancellor M Rezwan Khan and its board of trustee chairman Hasan Mahmood Raja were, among others, present on the occasion.

Nahid said the government will not provide its assistance to those private varsities which only want to make profit without fulfilling the government conditions.

Meanwhile, many private universities have been shut for not fulfilling the conditions to run the universities under the rules of the Private University Act-2010, the minister added.

‘It's not our motive to shut any university...we'll always try so that private varsities can run successfully to expand education in the country,’ he said.

Nahid also urged the university authorities to keep tuition and admission fees within the tolerable limit.
