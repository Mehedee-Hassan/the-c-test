Inu dismisses Mamata’s proposal
Information minister Hasanul Haq Inu on Monday said that the alternative proposal made by the West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee during the official visit of prime minister Sheikh Hasina to Delhi, is not acceptable yet.

‘No agreement was signed over Teesta water sharing issue yet as there is a complexity over the issue. The prime minister has placed the Teesta issue strongly. The stance of the prime minister would affect the political arena, media and people of the Indian side,’ said the minister while talking at a press briefing at the secretariat.

Talking about the defense deal, Inu said, ‘The deals would not convey any threat or risk for the Bangladesh Army, rather it will help to boost ability, skill and to create better training for Army.’

Bangladesh and India on Saturday signed 36 bilateral documents, covering diverse areas of cooperation, including economic and defence cooperation, power and peaceful use of nuclear energy, after official talks between prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi.

Those who are talking that the PM’s visit could not get anything for Bangladesh, I just told them that the deals including cyber security, nuclear power, information and communication technology, satellite and space reach filed and loan agreement between the two countries have introduced a new era of development for the both countries, he said.

Referring to Khaleda’s opposite stance over the deals, Inu said ‘I challenged Khaleda Zia though you (media) to say which agreement of MoUs signed between Bangladesh and India is against country’s interest? To which country is being sold and harmed the independence and sovereignty of Bangladesh? In which deal Bangladesh has lost one centimeter land from her sovereignty?’
