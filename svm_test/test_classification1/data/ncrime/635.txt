Local and international non-government organisations working in Bangladesh urged the president of the republic not to assent the Foreign Donations (Voluntary Activities) Regulation Bill 2016 which was passed on October 5 at the parliament.

At a press conference at Dhaka Reporters’ Unity, they also urged to amend the bill upon discussion with all NGO representatives and other stakeholders, scraping the section 14 of the bill and other undemocratic, risky and imaginary sections of the act.

The section 14 of the bill empowered the government to cancel registration of NGOs for making ‘derogatory and livid’ comments on the constitution and constitutional institutions.

Reading a written statement of the NGOs working in Bangladesh, Transparency International Bangladesh chairperson Sultana Kamal said the section 14 would create risk of scraping constitutional and fundamental rights of freedom of expression and conscience and freedom of organisation.

‘We urge the president not to approve the bill’, she said.

She alleged that the government actually wanted to control the NGOs and other voluntary activities in the name of transparency and accountability of the NGOs’ expenditure of foreign donations.

Sultana said the terms ‘derogatory and livid’ comments on the constitution and constitutional institutions was vague and the words could be interpreted and misinterpreted in various ways and thus create scope of misuse.

TIB executive director Iftekharuzzaman, Oxfam’s country director Snehal V Soneji, Care’s country director Jamie Terzi, BELA’s executive director Syeda Rizwana Hasan, and Nijera Kori coordinator Khushi Kabir, among others, spoke.
