Hasina may sell country completely: Khaleda
BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Saturday night accused prime minister Sheikh Hasina of ‘selling the country’ only to cling to power.

Speaking at a programme at her Gulshan office, the BNP chief warned that people will not spare Hasina for her ‘anti-state’ activities.

‘Hasina is dreaming of staying in power forever. That’s why she’s already done many anti-state activities. She’s selling everything the country has. She may return home having sold the country completely,’ Khaleda said.

She further said, ‘No one in the world who betrayed their country could save themselves. Hasina thinks to whom she is selling the country will come forward to save her. But they won’t save her when people will rise up.’

Stating that there is pent up anger among people against the misdeeds of the government, the BNP chief said it is now ‘only a matter of time” before people take to the streets to resist the current regime.’

Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal arranged the programme for the family members of slain Nurul Alam Nuru to meet Khaleda.

Family members and BNP alleged that Chittagong’s Rauzan police subinspector Sheikh Javed along with some other plainclothes police picked up JCD central committee assistant general secretary Nurul Alam Nuru from his Chandanpura residence in the port city on March 30, before killing him by firing 10 shots in his head in Bagowan area along the bank of the Karnaphuli River.

However, SI Javed dismissed the allegation, saying he has no idea about detaining Nuru.

Nuru’s widow Sumi Akter, his daughter and two sons met the BNP chief at about 9:15pm.

Khaleda consoled the family members and provided them a cheque of an undisclosed amount as donation from the party.

She accused the prime minister of indulging in killing innocent people, BNP leaders and activists regularly. ‘The time will come when Hasina will surely be tried on the soil of this country for her misdeeds.’
