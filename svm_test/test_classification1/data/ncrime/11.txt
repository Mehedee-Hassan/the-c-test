Over 150 UPs go to polls Sunday
More than 150 union parishads are going to polls in different upazilas of the country on Sunday.

Of the UPs, some 50 in 24 upazilas will have regular elections while there will be by-polls to different posts, including 17 of chairman posts, at the remaining UPs in 91 upazilas, according to Election Commission statistics.

EC deputy secretary Farhad Ahammad Khan said the commission declared election schedules for a total of 174 UPs, but elections to 20 UPs have been postponed due to legal complexities.

Elections only to the chairman post will be held along party line unlike the member posts and reserved seats.

The previous Election Commission, led by Kazi Rakibuddin Ahmad, arranged elections to over 4,000 UPs in six phases in 2016, which were largely marred by violence leaving over 100 people dead.
