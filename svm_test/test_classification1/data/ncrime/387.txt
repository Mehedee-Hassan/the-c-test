Oxford University based popular jazz band The Donut Kings entertained the Dhaka audience at a concert held at National Theatre Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy on Thursday.

The band members, using instruments like saxophones, flute, clarinet, trumpet, flugelhorn, trombones, piano, guitar and drums, swayed the audience with their performance at the event titled ‘Return to the Root’.

The full house crowd, who normally do not listen to jazz music, did not seem to miss anything, and encouraged the band members through clapping.

The show also featured performance by talented singer Izzy Gaffney, who covered some popular tracks like Glenn Miller’s In the Mood, Maynard Ferguson’s Fox Hunt, The Beatle’s Got to Get You into My Life, Frank Sinatra’s I’ve Got You Under My Skin, Steive Wonder’s Isn’t She Lovely and others in jazz compositions to the audience’s delight.

An instrumental presentation of Rabindranath Tagore’s Jadi Tor Daak Shune Keu Na Asey by the band was well enjoyed by the audience.

Bangladeshi-born Australian citizen Tanzil Rahman directed the concert by The Donut Kings; which includes 22 members, all studying at Oxford University.

Tanzil, who is currently pursuing his doctorate degree at Oxford, prepared the staff notation for the jazz orchestra.

‘For me performing in Bangladesh is like returning to the root. It is a pleasure and an honour to perform here’, Tanzil Rahman told New Age.

Cultural affairs minister Asaduzzaman Noor was the chief guest at the event, which was organised by 24th BCS Forum in association with the ministry of cultural affairs.
