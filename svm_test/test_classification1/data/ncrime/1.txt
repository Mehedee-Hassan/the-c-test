People will keep AL in power not India, says Obaidul
Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader on Monday said the people of the country would keep Awami League in power not India.

‘And the treaty on sharing of Teesta River water will be signed during the governments led by Narendra Modi and Sheikh Hasina’, he assured after monitoring activities of a mobile court in Kuchiamora area of Sirajdikhan this afternoon.

Talking to the reporters, the minister for roads and highways said Bangladesh Nationalist Party is playing the old record of anti-India propaganda as they are alienated from the people.

‘Since 1975, Bangladesh has been suffering a lot due to opposing India’, he added.

Bangladesh’s relation with India is for self-interest, Sheikh Hasina has taken this relation to a level which would resolve the unsetelled issues between the two countries, he added.
