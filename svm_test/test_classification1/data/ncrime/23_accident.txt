The injured were taken to SSKM Hospital. As of 9:00am, the fire was under control, fire service officers said to The Times of India.

The fire was first seen in the kitchen. Fire service officials said the blaze may have started there, set off by a short circuit. Soon, thick clouds of smoke billowed out and enveloped the entire hotel, according to the report in The Times of India.

The blaze reportedly sent hotel staff and guests into a panic, with three men trying to escape by jumping from the hotel's third floor, says the report.

Fire service officials rushed to the spot with as many as 10 fire tenders. Officials of the Disaster Management Group and police officers also reached the spot.
