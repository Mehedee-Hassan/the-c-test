Old town people meet mayor with empty vessels
A group of people in the Old Town of Dhaka joined an exchange of views with the south city mayor, Sayeed Khokon, on Sunday carrying empty vessels in their hands in protest at acute water crisis in their areas.

The residents of Gendaria and nearby areas turned up at Fazlul Haque Girls College where the mayor was scheduled to meet the local people to hear their complaints.

The residents complained that they were facing severe water crisis for long time and had to collect water standing on a queue holding jugs, pitchers, buckets etc. at late night when Dhaka WASA water trucks reached their areas.

The mayor, however, assured the people of solving their crisis within 15 days.

After receiving complaints about roads and sewerage system, Sayeed Khokon, said roads would be repaired within a short possible time. All street-lights would be repaired using LED bulbs within June, he added.

The programme presided over by ward no. 46 councillor, Shahidullah Minu, was also addressed by DSCC chief executive officer Khan Mohammad Bilal and other officials.
