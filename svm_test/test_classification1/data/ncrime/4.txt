TIB’s report intentional, aimed at maligning MPs: Chief Whip
Jatiya Sangsad chief whip ASM Feroz on Monday came down heavily on corruption watchdog Transparency International blaming it of maligning members of parliament internationally.

Blasting on TIB’s latest Parliament Watch report, Feroz said he thinks such report was published to malign MPs before people with evil intention.

He found the report ‘unnecessary’ and intentional.

Admitting quorum crisis in parliament, Feroz said it should not be presented negatively. He also said the assessment of financial loss due to quorum crisis was confusing and wrong.

He also claimed the TIB’s claim of not producing any international agreement before parliament was not right.

‘The article 145/A of the constitution says all such deals would be presented before the president and he would take measures to present them in parliament. There was no such move on the part of the president till date,’ he said.
