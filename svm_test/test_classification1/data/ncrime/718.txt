IU students lock Bangla department
A group of students of Bangla department of Islamic University in Kushtia on Tuesday locked main entrance of the department for two hours demanding their master’s examination in time.

Witness said around 50 students of the department gathered in front of the department and locked the main entrance of the department around 9:30am as the authorities failed to take their masters’ examination in time.

Finding no other way, they compelled to lock the department as their previous batch has already been finished their examination over three months ago, one of the agitating students said.

Later, the students withdrew their agitation after chairman of the department professor Gautom Kumar Dash assured them for looking into the matter.

The chairman said he would try to solve the problem after holding a discussion with the examination committee.
