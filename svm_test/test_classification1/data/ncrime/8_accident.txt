Worker killed in city factory fire
A worker died and seven others sustained burn injuries as a fire swept through a makeshift plastic shoe factory at West Islambagh in the capital Monday afternoon.

The fire broke out at Sikdar Plastic housed on the rooftop of a three-story building with a bang of exploding a chemical drum around 4:30pm, a witness said.

Sabbir Ahmed, 22, died on the spot when seven others sustained severe burn injuries, a fire official said.

The injured were admitted to DhakaMedicalCollege and Hospital.

Two units of fire fighters doused the fire and recovered the body, said Nasrin Sultana, a fire officer of Lalbagh Fire Service and Civil Defence, who visited the spot.

The fire might have originated from an electric short circuit or the blast of the chemical drum, she added.
