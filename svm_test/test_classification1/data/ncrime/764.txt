No alternative to vocational education for dev: Nahid
Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid on Saturday said there is no alternative to vocational education for development in the current competitive world.

‘We are yet to make desired progress in vocational education. Only one per cent of total students is undertaking vocation education in the country. Government has a plan to raise the percentage to 20 by 2020 and 30 by 2030,’ he said.

Nahid came up with the observations while addressing a function titled ‘Job Placement Celebration-2017’ at capital’s Krishibid Institute.

Organised by Saic Institute of Management and Technology, the function was presided over by its chairman Abu Hasnat Md Yahia. SMIT managing director Soheli Yasmin presented welcome speech at the function.

‘Skilled manpower is a prerequisite to national development for any country in the world.

There is no alternative to create skilled manpower for ensuring a developed and unemployment free educated country. Vocational education can play an important role in this regard,’ Nahid added.

Chief coordinator for Sustainable Development Goals affairs in the prime minister’s office Md Abul Kalam Azad, secretary of technical and madrassah education Md Alamgir, Institution of Diploma Engineers, Bangladesh president engineer AKMA Hamid, addressed the function, among others.
