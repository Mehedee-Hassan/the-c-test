Govt to start drive May 15 to ensure use of jute bags for packaging
The government would launch from May 15 a special drive across the country to ensure mandatory use of jute bags for packaging of 17 commodities including paddy, rice, wheat, maize, fertiliser and sugar.

The decision of conducting the special drive was taken in an inter-ministerial meeting held at the conference room of the textiles and jute ministry in the capital Dhaka on Sunday.

State minister for textiles and jute Mirza Azam presided over the meeting.

Azam said the government enacted the Mandatory Jute Packaging Act in 2010 to boost the use of environment-friendly jute bags for packaging of essential commodities.

But, he said, polythene or polypropylene bags are still being used for packaging of the commodities instead of jute bags despite a ban on their use.

Azam said that they had already given directives to the law enforcing agencies to take required steps for

implementing the Mandatory Jute Packaging Act-2010.

He also said that all the divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners had been directed to conduct special drive from May 15 to take action against any violation of the act.

In the act, the government primarily made mandatory the use of jute bags for packaging of six commodities — paddy, rice, wheat, maize, fertiliser and sugar.

On January 21, the government also made mandatory the use of jute bags for packaging of 11 other commodities including chilly, turmeric, onion, ginger, potato and flour.

The Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation was supposed to implement the Mandatory Jute Packaging Act-2010 from January 1, 2014 but it failed to enforce the act.
