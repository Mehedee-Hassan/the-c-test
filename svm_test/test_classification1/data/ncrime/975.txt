½ kg chicken breast

3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil

Few sprigs of fresh thyme

One slice of lime

1 tbsp fresh rosemary, chopped

1 tsp balsamic vinegar

Fresh black pepper

Salt

Clean the chicken breasts, and pat dry. You should have 4-6 slices in total. Place the chicken in a pan and add half of the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, and add the ginger paste, and balsamic vinegar, and mix well. Add the fresh thyme leaves and fresh rosemary, mix well, and leave to marinate for an hour.

In a baking pan, put the marinated chicken, add fresh lime juice and cover with aluminium foil paper. Cook in an oven for 20 -30 minutes at around 180°C.
