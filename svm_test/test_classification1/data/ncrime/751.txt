People rejected defence MoU with India, claims Rizvi
Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi on Sunday claimed that people ‘rejected’ the memorandum of understanding on defence cooperation between Bangladesh and India.

The MoU was signed during prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s visit to New Delhi on Saturday.

He said the government led by Sheikh Hasina exposed secrecy of Bangladesh’s security to India by signing the defence cooperation memos.

The BNP leader came up with the statements addressing a human chain organised by Bangladesh Jatiya Dal in front of National Press Club demanding just share of 54 common rivers waters and not to accept any ‘anti-state’ agreement.

About 22 deals and MoUs were signed between Bangladesh and Indian governments in presence of prime minister Sheikh Hasina and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi at Hyderabad House in New Delhi on Saturday.

He said people of Bangladesh had no support for the defence cooperation deal and would not allow its implementation.

Bangladesh Jatiya Dal president Syed Ehsanul Huda presided over the programme.
