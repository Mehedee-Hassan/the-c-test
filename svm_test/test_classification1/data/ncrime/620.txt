The Dhaka Stock Exchange and the Chittagong Stock Exchange have agreed to work together for the development of the country’s capital market and to push for different capital market-related demands.

The bourses reached the understanding at a meeting held at the DSE on Monday when a six-member CSE team visited the Dhaka bourse.

DSE acting managing director Abdul Matin Patwary said that the bourses should work together with a view to getting from the government different common facilities including tax-holiday for the bourses for the next three years, tax exemption on sales of 60 per cent shares of the demutualised bourses, increasing corporate tax gap between listed and non-listed companies by another 10 per cent and raising tax-free dividend income limit for general investors to Tk 1 lakh from Tk 25,000.

CSE chairman AK Abdul Momen said that there were ample opportunities for developing the capital market in line with the development of the country.

He also called on all the capital market actors to utilise the scopes.
