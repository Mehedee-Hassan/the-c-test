Khaleda said prime minister Sheikh Hasina's recent visit to India was an utterly failed visit. There was nothing receive but only to give away things, she said.

The BNP chief came up with the remarks addressing a news conference at her Gulshan office to inform her party's stance over recent singing of deals and MOUs with India.

Reacting to prime minister Sheikh Hasina's comment that she was satisfied with her India tour, Khaleda said people of Bangladesh are not satisfied with the outcome of the visit.

She said people did not want a bundle of deals and memos against the national interest rather they wanted realising their issues.

Khaleda said the incumbent government could not or did not protect the national interest in any agreement or MOUs signed with India.

She said signing sensitive matter like defense agreement or memorandum between the two countries keeping people in dark has deepened people’s mistrust.

Khaleda touched various visit related and recent issues during her around one hour confernce and replied a volley of question from journalists.

In reply to a question about any programme against the deals, she said news conference is the part of programme as people has to be informed.

She said her party's effort is to build up resistance in any issues against the national interest.

Reply to another query, she said if her party comes to power through a fair election, it would sign deals with countries relevent to protect the country's interest.
