Teachers and students of faculty of fine arts are working round the day for preparing replicas and other items to be used in the grand parade of Mongol Shobhajatra to welcome the Bangla New Year on April 14.

People from different walks of life take part in the procession that has been initiated by the FFA in 1989, but this year’s celebrations have special importance after getting recognition of Mangal Shobhajatra by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage on November 30, 2016, said the faculty dean Nisar Hossain.

While visiting the faculty, this correspondent saw students busy making masks, painting canvases and shoras; all of which will be sold to generate funds for this year’s Mangal Shobhaajatra.

‘We make artworks and sell those to generate funds ahead of Mangal Shobhajatra’, Nisar Hossain said.

Sculpture student Rameez Afroz said that there would be some dragon puppets, king and queen puppets, birds, tiger, fish, elephant, duck and others at the Mangal Shobhajatra this year.

‘This year, we will celebrate the declaration of Mangal Shobhajatra as an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO. For that we have already begun our preparations’, said Nisar Hossain, adding that the parade will also feature a number of structures used in previous year’s processions.

Alongside DU fine arts faculty, different government agencies and cultural organisations will bring out separate Mangal Shobhajatras across the country welcoming Bangla New Year 1424.

Cultural affairs ministry instructed branches of Shilpakala Academy, district and upazilla officials to organise the event following Mangal Shobhajatra’s selection as an intangible cultural heritage.
