Woman killed in Dhaka road crash in front of minor son
A woman was killed in a road crash in front of her six-year old son in Mohammadpur of Dhaka this morning.

The boy also suffered minor injury during the accident.

Doctors at Dhaka Medical College Hospital pronounced Sokhina Begum, 45, dead after she along with her son Md Yusuf, 6, were taken there soon after the accident.

Sokhina and her son were travelling to her elder daughterâ€™s place in Mohammadpur on a battery-run auto-rickshaw around 9:00am, Yusuf told our correspondent at the DMCH.

They fell off the vehicle when the auto-rickshaw driver suddenly took a turn to overtake a CNG-run three-wheeler at Bosila intersection, Yusuf said.

Yusuf said he lost father before he was born.

Rana Hassan, a passerby who took the duo to the hospital, said that he found them lying on the road after the accident.
