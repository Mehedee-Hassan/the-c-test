Sheltech will hold a two-week real estate fair starting from today at its office premises at Panthapath in Dhaka, marking its 29th anniversary.

‘The fair will begin on March 12 and continue till March 25 and if anyone books an apartment at the fair, the company will give him/her up to Tk 5 lakh discount,’ Toufiq M Seraj, managing director of Sheltech, said at a press conference held at the company’s office premises on Saturday.

Sheltech directors Tanvir Ahmed and Saamiya Seraj were also present at the event.

Toufiq said, ‘Our apartments are affordable as we build those keeping the low-income families in focus.’

Sheltech follows the Bangladesh National Building Code in constructing buildings and those buildings are capable of withstanding the code-specified natural forces like earthquake and wind, said Saamiya at the briefing.

‘The buildings are also fire protected with various fire equipment and services,’ she also said.

Sheltech has handed over around 3,500 apartments under its 160 projects in the last 29 years and 1,000 apartments are under construction, Tanvir informed.
