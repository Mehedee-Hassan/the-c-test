Two workers were killed and six others injured in a fire at a plywood manufacturing factory in Kushtia around noon yesterday.

Deceased Md Saifullah, 40, is from Jhenidah's Shailkupa upazila while ABM Rashidul Islam, 38, Chuadanga's Jibannagar.

Witnesses said around 100 workers were on the production floor of MRS Industries Ltd, a sister concern of BRB group, while the deceased were cleaning the corrugated tin roof when the fire erupted in one section.

The duo fell when the roof gave way for the fire and were later found to have died while the others suffered injuries either in the rush to get away from the fire or trying to douse it, said witnesses.

Firefighters put out the flames within a short time.

The company's chairman, Md. Mozibar Rahman, told The Daily Star that flammable chemicals used in the production might have somehow caught fire.

Kushtia Fire Service and Civil Defence Assistant Director Liakat Ali and Kushtia Model Police Station Officer-in-Charge Sahabuddin Choudhury acknowledged the events.
