Lawmakers have demanded stern actions against deputy commissioners who received lavish farewells from others.

Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal lawmaker Moin Uddin Khan Badal and Bangladesh Nationalist Front lawmaker SM Abul Kalam Azad, taking floor on point of order at the parliament on Sunday, termed the public farewell accorded to the deputy commissioners were ‘out of norm and odd looking’.

Referring to lavish farewells accorded to Mymensingh DC Mustakim Billah Faruqui, lawmaker Moin Uddin Khan Badal, said ‘a DC is taking reception wearing crown…it is really odd looking’.

‘We heard that a DC had taken 117 receptions,’ he added.

‘I urge cabinet secretary to take stern action against the DCs taking receptions,’ he added.

Mustakim Billah Faruqui was given number of farewells before his transfer to the civil aviation and tourism ministry as a deputy secretary.

Under the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules 1979, officials cannot receive receptions at workplace, officials said.

Sources said Mustakim’s farewell programmes spanned over 15 days — from September 3 to September 18 — and were hosted by the upazila administration, professional bodies and different socio-cultural organisations.

SM Abul Kalam Azad told the floor that he heard that DC of Chittagong also received reception.
