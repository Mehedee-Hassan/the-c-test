Shadhona to represent Bangladesh at Khajuraho Festival
Reputed Bangladeshi dance school Shadhona has been invited to represent Bangladesh as a theme region for the prestigious Khajuraho Dance Festival 2017, to be held at Khajuraho (Madhya Pradesh, India) from February 20- 26.

As the 'theme region', there will be a colourful display on the crafts and culture of Bangladesh in a pavilion specifically dedicated to Bangladesh, says a press release.

Besides, there will be daily performances of dances from Bangladesh on an open-air stage before each day's main performance. Bangladesh will be presenting Raibeshe, Baul, Poddar Nachon and other folk dances, “Badolo Borishone” (a dance-drama based on Nazrul's story and songs), Manipuri from Srimangal, “Aye Amader Ongone” (a dance drama based on Tagore's “Brikkhoropon”) and patriotic dances from the Language Movement.

The choreographers for the presentations are Shabbir Ahmed Khan (Biju), Sweety Das Chowdhury and Amit Chowdhury. Renowned Baul Singer Shafi Mondol will accompany the troupe, which includes dancers, Dhulis, Lathiyals and Manipuri performers from Sylhet.

The highlight of Bangladesh's participation will be a Bharatanatyam recital by noted dancer Amit Chowdhury and his students from the dance school Kolpotoru. Amit Chowdhury is a well-known dancer and has participated in several festivals at home and in India.

Bangladesh's participation will be supported by Bangladesh Tourism Board of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism, of the Government of Bangladesh.
