School football likely in June
Bangladesh Football Federation is planning to hold the National School Football Championship in June this year following financial assurance from FIFA under Forward Programme, said an official on Monday.

The National School Football Championship was scheduled for February 1 as per the four-year calendar of the BFF,

but the organisation failed to start it timely due to lack of fund.

The BFF said it has now overcome the problem as FIFA development committee last week approved $1,12,500 [Tk 90 lakh approximately] for the school football championship.

‘BFF president [Kazi Salahuddin] gave me the go-ahead signal to arrange the school football championship and we [school tournament committee] would soon sit in a meeting to fix everything’, said Bijon Barua, chairman of the school football tournament committee, on Monday.

‘I have a plan to start the championship in June after the first-term examination of schools.

‘With the FIFA fund, we can hold the school tournament with the participation of 64 schools, one each from 64 districts,’ Bijon said, adding that they were planning to include more school provided they get response from a potential sponsor.

‘We will include more schools from the Upazila level, if Islami Bank accepts our proposal and we are really eagerly waiting for their response.’

Islami Bank had provided Tk five crore for 2012 national school championship but declined to continue the gesture despite promise.
