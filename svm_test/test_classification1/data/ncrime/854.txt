Kalikaprasad Bhattacharjee, the eminent Bangalee folk musician who died recently in a road accident, was remembered in a ceremony by Nagarnat, a theatre-musical troupe of Sylhet. The tribute included a musical presentation decorated with the songs Kalika presented with his band Dohar.

The programme was held in front of Sylhet Central Saheed Minar on Saturday afternoon. People from many cultural walks of Sylhet shared their feelings and memories with Kalikaprasad, who was originally from Sylhet and often came to the region from his home in India to research folk music.

The musical presentation started with recently released “Bhuban Majhi” song “Ami Tomari Naam Gai”, which was a creation of Kalikaprasad. The musical tribute followed with “Gari Chole Na”, “Milon Hobe Koto Dine”, “Amar Jokhon Jagli Nare”, “Shuwa Urilo”, “Bhalo Achi Bhalo Theko” and many other songs.

They said Kalikaprasad was not only a singer, but also a man with full heart for Bangla folk music. He brought the folk heritage of Bangladesh to West Bengal and the world and the practice of folk music he spread will keep him alive forever, the speakers said.
