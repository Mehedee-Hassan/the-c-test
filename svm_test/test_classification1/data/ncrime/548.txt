Abahani leave for India today
Abahani Limited will fly for India today to play their third AFC Cup match against Bengaluru FC, scheduled at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium, Bangalore on April 18.

The Bangladesh Premier League champions are at the bottom of Group E after losing their first two matches while Bengaluru are at the top of the table after their two back to back wins against Mohun Bagan and Maziya Sports and Recreation Club.

Like the previous match against Mohun Bagan, who beat Abahani by 3-1, the traditional Sky Blue outfits are going to miss the service of the Ghanaian defender Samad Eussif as he failed to get his Indian visa.

Abahani’s assistant coach Amalesh Sen said if they fail to win the next match then the team’s hope of qualifying into the next level would finish.

‘We are yet to get any point which means to keep the hopes alive we have to win against Bengaluru,’ said Amalesh.

‘A defeat would end our hopes of qualifying for the next stage.’
