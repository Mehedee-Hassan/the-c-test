Eunus’ abstract paintings depict surroundings
A painting by Mohammad Eunus.

Celebrated painter Mohammad Eunus depicts surroundings through works displayed at his 41st solo show underway at Edge Gallery in Gulshan.

Titled ‘An Abstract Affair’, the show features 69 paintings by the artist.

In the paintings - done in oil and mixed media - the artist depicts reality through abstract compositions.

The displayed works at the show may appear meaningless and disorderly at first glance but with a more observant look one can notice a resemblance between the shapes in the paintings and everyday reality.

Effects of time, rotation of day and night, the cycle of seasons, the scorching heat of summer, freezing cold of winter, everyday objects, nature and more have been depicted in the paintings displayed at the exhibition.

His oil on canvas work titled ‘Uneasy Rest’ resembles boats plying on a river. The work is dominated by brush strokes of different shades of blue. The painting depicts shapes which look like traditional boats floating on a black river. The artist has placed the boats on the black portion of the painting to depict the disappearing of rivers in the country.

The work titled ‘Composition 1’ is a beautiful oil painting in which Eunus shows an old, mossy wall and an open window.

The artist has depicted coming of night in his work titled ‘Beauty at Night’ which shows a rectangular structure in strokes of black and white with scratch marks covering most of the canvas. The painting also includes an owl within the rectangular shape.

The exhibition, which began on March 18, will remain open for all from 10am to 8pm till March 31.
