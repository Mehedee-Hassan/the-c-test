The three-act drama features three short stories by Urdu iconic writer and poet from India named Ismat Chughtai, including Chui Mui, Gharwali and Mughal Bacha.

All the three stories deal with women and their survival in a patriarchal society.

The first act, Chui Mui, enacted by Heeba Shah, tells the story of a woman whose only aim is to be mother of a child.

The second act, Mughal Bacha, enacted by Ratna Pathak Shah, features how the historic characters had to bear the burden of their husbands’ arrogance.

The third act, Gharwali, performed by Naseeruddin Shah, narrates the story of an oppressed woman.

Blues Communications CEO Farhadul Islam said the organization would arrange more diversified shows featuring world famous artistes and troupes in future.
