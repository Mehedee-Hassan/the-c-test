No ‘Gate Lock’ or ‘Sitting Service’ from Sunday
No bus will be allowed to ply the city streets in the name of 'Sitting Service' or 'Gate Lock' from Sunday, said chairman of the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority Md Moshiar Rahman on Saturday.

He came up with the announcement while talking to reporters after a meeting between BRTA and leaders of bus owners at the BRTA head office in the city.

Moshiar said seats must be set aside in every public bus for women and physically-challenged people, and the bus staff must not misuse those reserved seats.

He said action will be taken if anyone charges extra fares from passengers, and the fare chart, as fixed by BRTA, must be hung at a visible place inside every bus so that all can easily see it.

General secretary of Dhaka Sarak Paribahan Samiti Khandker Enayetullah said drives, led by BRTA magistrates, will be conducted to enforce the decision.

He said the decision is being implemented to bring all the passenger buses under a discipline in the capital.

Dhaka Sarak Paribahan Samiti, an association of owners of passenger buses in the capital, at its general meeting on April 4 last decided that no bus will be allowed to operate in Dhaka city in the name of 'Sitting Service' or 'Gate Lock' from April 15 as additional fares are being charged from passengers in the guise of such services.

About the delay in implementing the decision, Khandker Enayetullah said it was not possible to execute the decision on the stipulated date as the association leaders could not sit on Friday with BRTA due to Pahela Baishakh public holiday and weekend.

‘We sat in the meeting with BRTA on Saturday. So, our previous decision will be enforced from Sunday,’ he said.
