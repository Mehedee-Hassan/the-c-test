Govt trying to form another 'spineless' EC: BNP
Bangladesh Nationalist Party senior leader Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain on Friday alleged that the government is trying to form another 'spineless' Election Commission through a search committee.



Speaking at a discussion, ‘People have seen the activities of Rakibuddin-led spineless Election Commission. They won't accept if another such Election Commission is formed.’



Swadhinata Forum, a pro-BNP platform, arranged the programme at the Jatiya Press Club in memory of late BNP standing committee member ASM Hannan Shah.



The tenure of the current Kazi Rakibuddin Ahmad-led Election Commission will expire in February next.



About the attack on Sylhet college girl Khadiza Aketr reportedly by BCL man, Mosharraf said terrorists

and militants have got now desperate as there is no democracy in the country.



Referring to the prime minister's remarks that whether people have lost their human values as they recorded Khadiza's attack instead of saving her, the BNP leader said it is the BCL men not people who have lost their human values. "The prime minister should have told in parliament that Chhatra League lacks moral and human values.’



The BNP leader said BCL men are creating anarchy everywhere, including at the education institutions, by resorting to terrorism, plundering and tender manipulation.



He called upon all to be vocal against the misdeeds by the ruling party student body.





Mosharraf, a BNP standing committee member, said the government has no moral right to stay in office anymore as people did not vote it.



Recalling the contributions of Hannan Shah to BNP and democracy, he urged his party leaders to get united following his ideals for the restoration of democracy
