Recitation artiste Shimul Mustapha recited a total of 71 poems at a solo show at Rabindra Sarobor in Dhanmondi on Friday, as a tribute to the martyrs and freedom fighters of the 1971 war of independence.

The show marked Shimul’s seventh consecutive annual performance at the Rabindra Sarobor area.

He chose poems of diverse themes for the show, titled ‘Apash Korini Kokhonoi Ami Ei Holo Itihas.’ Mostly he recited patriotic poems and poems of social protest and revolution, some directly related to the war.

Among them were Rabindranath Tagore’s Ananta Prem and Niruddesh Jatra, Kazi Nazrul Islam’s Kandari Hushiyar, Jibanananda Das’s Motorcar and Antorchad, Nirmalendu Goon’s Pratham Otithi, and Syed Shamsul Haq’s Amar Itihas and Poraner Gahin Bhitore.

After reciting 25 poems at a stretch, Shimul led the way for the audience and a group of singers who joined their voices to present the patriotic song Sabkota Janala Khule Dao Na.

They then lighted 1971 candles in memory of the martyrs and freedom fighters.

‘I have been organising this show at Rabindra Sarobor since 2009. This is a special occasion for me as I have an opportunity to pay my respects to the martyrs and celebrate the victory,’ said Shimul Mustapha.
