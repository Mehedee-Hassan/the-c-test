A documentary based on Shawkat Osman’s short story Phera was screened on Tuesday at the Central Public Library as part of the two-day birth centenary celebrations programme of the late writer.

The 10-minute documentary, directed by Mainul Shahid, features that creative people are remembered in the world more than the rich through the story of a baul and a landlord.

The concluding day of the birth centenary programme also featured discussion and a cultural show.

Shawkat Osman Smrity Parishad and Bangladesh Udichi Shilpigoshthi jointly organised the programme.

Former Udichi president Kamal Lohani, current Udichi president Dr Shafiuddin Ahmed, actor Tabibul Islam Babu and Shawkat Osman’s son and also a filmmaker Jean Nesar Osman spoke at the programme.

‘It is regrettable that even after 18 years of Shawkat Osman’s death, we have not got an anthology of Osman’s writings’, said Kamal Lohani.

Lohani also highlighted Shawkat Osman’s contributions to the social reformation through his writings and active participation.

‘A true patriot with an enlightened spirit, Osman was always vocal against religious bigotry, political and social injustice throughout his life’, said Lohani.

Jean Nesar Osman recalled his memories with his father. ‘Shawkat Osman was an endowed teacher, who loved to learn from others and also liked to teach people.’

Following the discussion, Nrityachhanda artistes presented a chorus dance recital synchronised with Rabindranath Tagore’s devotional song Jogote Anandajogge Amar Nimantran.

Singer Anan Baul and Jahid Kamal rendered songs.

The two-day celebrations programme began on Monday with events like seminar, discussion and a theatre show.
