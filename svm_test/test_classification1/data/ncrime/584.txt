SC upholds Rizvi’s bail, no bar to be released
The Supreme Court on Sunday upheld the High Court order that granted bail to BNP senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi in an arson case filed with Ramna Police Station.

Chamber judge of the Appellate Division justice Syed Mahmud Hossain passed ‘no order’ following a petition filed by the state.

As per the order, now there is no bar to release the BNP leader from the jail, said Rizvi’s counsel Sagir Hossain.

On October 13, the High Court granted six months anticipatory bail to the BNP leader in the case.

On January 18, 2015, police filed a case against Rizvi on charge of attempting to kill police after hurling petrol bombs on a vehicle.

Besides, five more cases were filed against the BNP leader in this connection.

On August, 18, this year, Ruhul Kabir Rizvi surrendered before the court and the court sent him to jail after rejecting his bail petitions in the cases.

The High Court on September 7 granted bail to Ruhul Kabir Rizvi in five cases.
