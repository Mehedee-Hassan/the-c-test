Writ seeks removal of statue from SC premises
A writ was filed with the High Court on Sunday seeking removal of the statue of Greek goddesses from the Supreme Court premises.

Advocate AK Azad on behalf of his client Mohammad Arifur Rahman filed the writ petition.

In the petition, the court was urged to issue a rule asking the government to explain as to why directives should not be given to remove the statue from SC premises.

Secretaries to religious affairs ministry, law ministry, public works ministry, Supreme Court registrar general and registrar, chief engineer and executive engineer of public works department and secretary of Supreme Court Lawyers Association were made respondents to the rule.

According to the writ petition, the installation of a statue in front of the Supreme Court is contradictory to articles 12 and 23 of the Constitution.

It also hurts the religious sentiment of the people as 95 per cent people of the total population are Muslims.

The statue of Greek goddess was set up on the Supreme Court premises in December last.
