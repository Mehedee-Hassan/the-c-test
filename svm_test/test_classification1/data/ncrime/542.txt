5 stumpings in an innings now in Div-2
Amazing things continued to happen in Dhaka Second Division Cricket League that hit the global headlines over the past few days, despite being only lower-tier competitions.

After digital manipulation of the scorecard and a 92 runs inning of four balls, a wicketkeeper now recorded five stumpings in an innings in the league on Thursday.

Axiom Cricketers wicketkeeper Ashique Shiam accomplished five stumpings in an innings to help his side dismiss Green Leaf Cricket Academy for 181 runs despite the side sitting pretty at one stage to reach 142-1 in 25 overs.

Axiom, who allegedly received continuous backing from a Bangladesh Cricket Board director, won the game by nine wickets,

their fourth successive wins, where opener Mustafizur Rahman chipped in with 103 off 61 balls.

Shiam’s feat raised quite a few eyebrows as five stumpings in an innings are rare in cricket.

It happened only once in Test cricket when India’s Kiran More achieved the feat in the fourth innings of a game against West Indies at Chennai in 1988.

One-day international or Twenty20 international never saw a wicketkeeper making five stumpings in an innings so far.
