SC clears way for holding FBCCI election
The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the High Court order that stayed the process of holding the FBCCI election for two months.

A three-member bench of the Appellate Division, led by Chief Justice S K Sinha, passed the order.

M Badruddoza Badal, lawyer of Aminul Haque Shamim, president of Mymensingh Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said though the Appellate Division rejected the HC order but it also asked the FBCCI election committee to nominate a representative from MCCI and include his name in the FBCCI voter list by May 30.

The Appellate Division passed the order as Attorney General Mahbubey Alam informed the court that a decision was taken to insert the name of a representative from MCCI after a meeting held between the authorities concerned of FBCCI and MCCI, he said.

Earlier, on March 27, the Supreme Court adjourned the hearing on a petition filed over the process of holding election to the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry till March 30.

The Chamber Judge’s issued the rule after a hearing on the petition filed by the FBCCI against an HC order that stayed the process of holding the election for two months on March 23.

The election is scheduled to be held on May 14. The FBCCI announced the schedule on February 14.

On March 22, the HC stayed for two months the election after a hearing on a writ petition filed on February 6 by Shamim, president of the MCCI, seeking a stay on the process allowing the MCCI to get enlisted in the FBBCI voter list.

In his petition, Aminul Huq alleged that there are anomalies in the voter list as his name is not there in it.

Mymensingh was a made a division in 2015 and the local chamber of commerce and industry pleaded to the FBCCI in 2016 for its inclusion, but the process has not forwarded over the last one year.
