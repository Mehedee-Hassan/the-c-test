Cultural organisations bid adieu to Bangla Year 1423 by organising colourful Chaitra Sangkranti celebrations programmes at different venues in the capital on Thursday.

Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy and Bangladesh Group Theatre Federation organised separate programmes at two venues of the academy while Surer Dhara held a Chaitra Sangkranti Utsab at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre.

Both of the shows featured display of traditional performing arts like lathi khela (tricks with sticks), gambhira, puppet show, puthipath and others.

BSA invited a troupe from Chapainawabganj to stage gambhira, a troupe from Sirajganj to present lathikhela and Bangladesh Puppetry Development Academy to display putul naach.

Bangladesh Group Theatre Federation’s programme began with lighting of candles.

The event featured sarod recital by Ustad Shahadat Hossain Khan, staging of a pala titled ‘Gazikalu Champabati’ by a Mymensingh-based troupe and gambhira by Chapainawabganj -based troupe Chapai Gambhira.

Surer Dhara’s programme featured presentation of Rabindra Sangeet glorifying the spring.

The show commenced with a chorus presentation of Antoro Momo Bikoshito Koro. Child artistes rendered Moumachhi and Sob Kaje Haat Lagai Mora.

Parts of Tagore’s dance drama Kal Mrigaya and Tagore’s play Achalayatan were staged by Surer Dhara artistes.

The event ended at midnight with rendition of the songs Byartho Praner Aborjona and Esho Hey Baishakh.
