Fire from elevator crash ‘kills 4’ in Uttara mall
A fire in a high-rise market in Dhaka’s Uttara today, said to be caused by an elevator crash, has reportedly left at least four people dead and about a dozen other injured.

The fire initiated with an explosion at 17-storied Alauddin Market around 6:15pm, witnesses said. Smoke was seen coming out from the third, fourth and fifth floors.

Bangla daily Prothom Alo quotes Fire Service and Civil Defence headquarters operator Mahmudul Hasan to report that four people, including a woman, died in the incident.

However, the daily quoted Bidhan Tripura, police deputy commissioner of Uttara (north division), to say that the casualty toll had risen to five by evening.

The Daily Star could not independently verify the casualties.

An elevator snapped and crashed, Kazi Shahan Haque, inspector (investigation) of Uttara Model Police Station told The Daily Star. “It crashed in the basement and started the fire.”

Nearly 20 people were injured in the incident, he added. “Some received burn injuries.”

Fire Service and Civil Defense headquarters confirmed The Daily Star that an explosion was heard before the fire. Thirteen units brought the fire under control around 7:25pm.

Mozammel Haque, deputy director of Bangladesh Fire Service and Civil Defense, who led a rescue mission, said the explosion ripped apart the market’s basement and shattered the window panes.

He said he saw three victims who were apparently in critical condition. They were sent to Uttara campus of Bangladesh Medical College Hospital.

Dhaka Medical College Hospital police sources said three of the injured, that included a 10-year-old girl, an eight-month-old boy and their father, were admitted to the hospital with burn injuries.
