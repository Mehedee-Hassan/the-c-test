Cultural organisation Shilpita organised the programme to mark the International Women’s Day.

Upcoming female poets presented their poems addressing woman issues at the programme, which also included a discussion session.

Poet Merina Syed recited Jibanta Kingbadanti in her powerful voice. Through the poem, the poet paid tribute to all the mothers of the world.

Shamana Nahar’s poem Narir Shram addressed wage discrimination of the female workers.
