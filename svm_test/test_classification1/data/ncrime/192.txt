Seasoned Dhallywood villain Sadek Bachchu is all set to make a comeback in theatre with his play titled ‘Kaphoner Pocket Nai’ to be produced by Motijheel Theatre.

Bachchu, president of the troupe, has written the play, will direct it and also act in a central role.

Bachhu, who began his acting career through theatre, said, ‘I had been thinking of coming back to theatre for some time now. I am happy that at last I have returned to theatre’.

The play Kaphoner Pocket Nai will be premiered on November 10, marking Motijheel Theatre’s 33rd founding anniversary.

‘I have completed the play. Now we are selecting our cast and soon we will start rehearsal’, informed Bachchu.

Bachchu’s association with theatre dates back to his early teen years. The actor first appeared on stage in Rabindranath Tagore’s Daakghar when he was a student of class five.

In the mid 1980s, when Motijheel Theatre was formed by a group of theatre activists from area, Bachchu joined the troupe and worked for it as a playwright, director and actor.

‘My first direction in theatre was Shyamol Bhattacharya’s Khudiramer Ma in 1987’, recalled Bachchu, who has so far written plays like Kato Din Ei Din, Katipayer Britanta and Kulangar.

Besides, he has directed a few other plays for Motijheel Theatre but the actor gradually became separated from theatre in the late 1990s as he became busy in the silver screen.

One of the famous actors in negative roles in Dhallywood, Bachchu, who debuted in silver screen with Ramer Sumati in 1985, has acted in over 300 films.

At present, he is working in a number of films including Shahadat Hossain Liton’s Ahangkar, Shamim Ahmed Rony’s Dhatiriki and Shamimul Islam Shamim’s Golaptalir Kajal.
