BNP hails AL’s upcoming national council
BNP on Tuesday hailed Awami League’s upcoming national council and hoped that it will pave the way for the ‘restoration’ of democracy in the country.

‘Awami League is the oldest traditional party in Bangladesh. We welcome their council and wish its all-out success,’ said BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam.

He further said, ‘We also hope that they (AL) will play their due role in restoration of democracy though this council. Not only BNP but also the country’s people expect such a role from the Awami League leadership.’

Fakhrul came up with the remark while talking to reporters at BNP chairperson’s Gulshan office.

Earlier, the BNP secretary general went to Thai Embassy here and signed the condolence book opened there following the death of its king Bhumibol Adulyadej.

Fakhrul regretted that though Awami League had struggled and played important role in establishing democracy in the past, unfortunately democracy has been hindered and annihilated repeatedly.

He accused the government of creating a political crisis in the country and urged it to take proper steps to overcome it.

‘Awami League should take initiatives right now to dissolve the country’s political crisis and restore people’s all rights alongside restoration of democracy. We hope Awami League will take such a decision at their council,’ Fakhrul added.

Awami League, also the ruling party of the country, will hold their national council on October 22-23 at Suhrawardy Udyan in the city.
