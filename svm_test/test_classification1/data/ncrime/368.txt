Chhayanaut celebrated the spring on Friday at its auditorium in Dhanmondi where students of the organisation rendered songs penned by three great bards including, Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam and Atul Prasad Sen.

The students of the organisation also presented colourful dance recitals synchronised with the songs glorifying beauty of the season.

The programme began with a group dance performance accompanied by a chorus rendition of Rabindranath Tagore’s song on spring Ore Bhai Phagun Legeche Bone Bone.

The students also staged a dance performance with a chorus of

Atul Prasad Sen’s Mora Nachi Phule Phule.

Samudra Shubrom and Devjyoti Kor duo sang Kazi Nazrul Islam’s popular song glorifying the season titled ‘Basanta Elo Elo Elo Re’. The audience was moved with the lyrics and composition of the number, penned by the national poet.

Tanisha Jahan rendered Rabindra Sangeet Diye Genu Basanter Ei Gaan Khani, Namira Musran sang Nazrul Sangeet Sundar Otithi Eso Eso and Arpita Das presented another Nazrul song Aji Dol Faguner Dol Legechhe.

A remarkable number of viewers enjoyed the show.
