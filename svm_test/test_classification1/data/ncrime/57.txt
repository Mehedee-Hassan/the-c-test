Display centre to promote jute goods opened
The Textile and Jute Ministry Thursday opened a jute goods display centre in the capital with a view to promote some 134 types of diversified jute goods.

Textile and jute minister Muhammad Imaj uddin Pramanik inaugurated the display and sales center as the chief guest at the Jute Diversification Promotion Centre.

Considering economic and environmental importance of jute, the ministry established JDPC in the capital in 2002.

‘Jute Diversification and Promotion Centre will increase the demand of jute goods in locally as well as internationally and help to revive the lost heritage of the golden fibre,’ said the minister while inaugurating the JDPC.

JDPC’s executive director Nasima Begum gave the welcome address at the function while acting textile and jute secretary Shubhashish Basu chaired the function.

State minister for textile and jute Mirza Azam also spoke as the special guest.

‘A ban on the use of plastic bags in different countries including US, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia has opened new opportunities for diversified jute products,’ said Rashedul Karim Munna, general secretary of Bangladesh Jute Diversified Products Manufacturers and Exporters Association.

The global demand for shopping bags is about 500 billion pieces, worth around $500 billion a year, according to International Jute Study Group.

The US, Europe and China would be the biggest markets for shopping bags,

once the ban on the use of plastic bags would come into effect.

Thai ambassador in Bangladesh Panpimon Suwannapongse, senior officials from ministries, representatives of different national and international agencies and local jute goods manufacturers, among others, were present at the opening ceremony.
