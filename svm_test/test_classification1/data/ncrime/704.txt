Flood situation worsens in Sylhet, Sunamganj
Flood situation worsened in Sylhet and Sunamganj Haor belt on Monday as the area experienced moderate rainfall that raised water levels with onrush of water from hills across the border.

Bangladesh Water Development Board recorded 33mm rainfall at Kanaighat and 30mm in the Sylhet city in twelve hours ending at 9:00am Monday.

The flood protection embankment that was protecting 9,000 hectares of standing Boro rice in Sunamganj’s Sanir Haor finally gave in to the rising water level on Monday.

Meanwhile, reports of fodder crisis forcing farmers to sell out their cattle herds at a much lower price were increasing.

Tahirpur sadar union chairman Borhan Uddin told New Age that barns and cowsheds wore a deserted look as farmers were forced to sell most of the cattle in last couple of days.

‘Farmers are charging very cheap price for their cattle,’ said Borhan.

Sunamganj Department of Agricultural Extension’s deputy director Zahedul Haque said they could not help the farmers anyway under the circumstances.

The New Age correspondent in Moulvibazar reported that flood situation in the district remained unchanged on Monday.

The flood continued to inundate the Haor belt along seven districts in the country’s north eastern part for the 13th consecutive day on Monday.
