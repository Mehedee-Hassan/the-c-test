A book on the life and works of renonwed musician-singer Sachin Dev Burman was launched on Wednesday at Bangladesh National Museum.

The 544-page book, titled ‘Sachin Dev Burman: Marter Rajya Chhere Surer Samrajje’, has been written by Advocate Golam Faruk.

Comilla district administration has published the book.

Cultural affairs minister Asaduzzaman Noor was present at the programme as the chief guest. Emeritus professor Anisuzzaman, poet Asad Chowdhury, Muhammad Nurul Huda and others were also present at the programme.

‘For the last ten years, I had been working on the book. As a resident of Comilla, I thought that it is my responsibility to tell the story of one of the most endowed musicians from Comilla’, said Advocate Golam Faruk.

The ten-chapter book charts Sachin Dev Burman’s family history and his supremacy in the world of music.
