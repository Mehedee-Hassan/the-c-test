Theatre troupe Byatikrom Natyagoshthi staged a monodrama titled ‘Durasha’ at Studio Theatre hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy on Wednesday.

An adaptation of Rabindranath Tagore’s short story with the same title, the play, adapted and directed by Saiful Islam Sohag, features story of unfulfilled love of a Muslim woman with a Hindu man through the character of Nurunnisa played by Syeda Nawshin.

In the monodrama Nurunnisa, the daughter of a Muslim nawab in British India, embraced the ascetic life after her love is rejected by a Hindu general of her father’s army named Keshorelal, who even refuses to drink water in hand of a Muslim woman Nurunnisa.

The play concludes depicting a tragic scene where ascetic Nurunnisa after many years finds Keshorelal leading a family after marrying a Buddhist Bhutia woman.
