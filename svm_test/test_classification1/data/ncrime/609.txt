Call for end of hostility and ensure assistance to famine affected areas
The 136th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly on Tuesday urged relevant governments to end hostilities and take every step to ensure unhindered humanitarian access to save millions of people from famine and drought in parts of Africa and Yemen.

In an emergency item adopted at the five-day assembly being held in Dhaka from Saturday, participants and member countries also committed to pressuring their governments to fund humanitarian relief operations to avert this crisis.

People are facing the third consecutive year of drought in many of the countries covered by the emergency item. The impact is devastating, causing thirst and hunger, decimating livestock, destroying livelihoods, spreading disease and triggering large-scale population movements, said an IPU press statement.

Ethiopia and Kenya are among the world’s top 10 refugee host countries. These refugees are especially vulnerable in the current crisis.

IPU members called upon the international community to take immediate action to prevent this potentially unprecedented famine and looming humanitarian catastrophe. They urged relevant governments to end hostilities and take every step to ensure unhindered humanitarian access.

The IPU resolution declared that the United Nations should commit the resources necessary to provide humanitarian support and nutritional relief. It stressed that particular attention needs to be focused on the most vulnerable groups, especially women, children and the aged.

IPU members also want to prevent this tragedy from ever happening again. They urged governments to assist the affected countries in developing drought resilience mechanisms, including by eliminating the root causes of famine and drought. Parliamentarians also called for more investment in mitigation activities that support vulnerable countries in adapting to climate change.
