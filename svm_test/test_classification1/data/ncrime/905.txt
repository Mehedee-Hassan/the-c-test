Manipuri Handloom Project
Since the 1970s, Oxfam has been working in Bangladesh through different projects to reduce poverty. Seven months ago, one such initiative was taken on by Oxfam – the “Manipuri Handloom Project.” The Manipuri people in Bangladesh have always excelled in the art of handloom and for the longest time all their requirements were self-met. With the local partner Ethnic Community Development Organisation (EDCO), Oxfam set out to train these people to take their art onto a stage where they can make a sustainable livelihood out of it. With that in mind, Oxfam started working with the people in Sylhet and Moulovibazar to build the capacity of Manipuri women under the guidance of noted designer Chandra Shekhar Saha.

On 8 April, 2015, just months after the conception of the project, the Exposition of Manipuri Textile Products was inaugurated at the Krishibid Institutions Complex in Khamar Bari, Farmgate. The program started with an indigenous dance performed by Monipuri girls. The welcome speech of Saikat Biswas, the Project Co-ordinator of Oxfam started the inauguration officially. The Deputy Governor of Bangladesh Bank, Md. Abul Quasem attended as the chief guest. Managing Director of SME foundation Dr. Engr. Syed Md. Ihsanul Karim, Country Director of Oxfam Snheal V. Soneji, and Actress Afsana Mimi were also present.

The exposition showcased different handloom and textile products made by the Manipuri women with focus on their traditional motifs and designs. The exposition opened for all on 9 April, 2015 and continued from 10:00am to 9:00pm and drew a diverse crowd.
