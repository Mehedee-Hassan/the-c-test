Prime minister Sheikh Hasina paid a courtesy call on Indian president Pranab Mukherjee at Rashtrapati Bhaban in India’s capital New Delhi Sunday evening.

PM’s press secretary Ihsanul Karim said that they had discussed various matters relating to bilateral interests, including the decisions agreed by the two countries at the previous day’s talks between Sheikh Hasina and Narendra Modi.

The Indian president said that he was very much touched personally with the gesture of Sheikh Hasina as she had taken the trouble to visit India to convey her compassion after demise of his wife Suvra Mukherjee.

The premier thanked Pranab Mukherjee for his wholehearted support to Bangladesh’s Liberation War in 1971.

They also reminisced the memories which both their families shared during Sheikh Hasina’s exile life in India after the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975, the press secretary said.

Indian president praised Sheikh Hasina’s constant efforts to take forward Bangladesh and establish the relations between the two counties on a solid foundation.

Later on the night, Sheikh Hasina was to join a dinner to be hosted in her honour by the Indian president.
