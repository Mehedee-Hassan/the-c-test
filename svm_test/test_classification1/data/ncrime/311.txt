When asked about his selection, Sunny said in a statement: ‘We received a brochure in our school about the audition happening for the film in Andheri and lot of my classmates were going to the place. So even I went there with my father for the audition and after reaching the venue they made me play and run and that’s how I got selected for this role.’
