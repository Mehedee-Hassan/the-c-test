Leave hilsa off Pahela Baishakh menu: PM
The prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, on Tuesday urged the people of the country leave hilsa off the menu of their Pahela Baishakh, the first day of the Bengali Year, and add fresh ones to it on the day.

She came up with the request at a press conference at her official residence Ganabhaban organised to brief the media about her just concluded four-day India visit.

‘Please, don't take hilsa on Pahela Baishakh, don't catch hilsa. Please, take khichuri, vegetables, burned dry chili and omelet or egg fry on the day,’ she said.

This is the season for mother hilsa to release eggs, and the government has imposed a ban on catching hilsa for 30 days (March-April).

The prime minister did not include hilsa in her Pahela Baishakh menu at Ganabhaban last year.
