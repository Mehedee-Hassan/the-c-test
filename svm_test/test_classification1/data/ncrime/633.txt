Khaleda welcomes Xi
Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson Khaleda Zia welcomed Chinese president Xi Jinping and hoped that Bangladesh’s ties with the East Asian country will be consolidated further.

In message of felicitation, she said, ‘BNP welcomes Chinese president Xi Jinping to Bangladesh. BNP and the country’s people believe the ties between Bangladesh and China are historically very deeper,’ she said.

Mentioning that BNP founder Ziaur Rahman had established diplomatic ties with China in 1977, Khaleda said the friendly country has continued its support to the people of Bangladesh since then.

‘Undoubtedly, Xi Jinping’s this tour will make the ties between the two nations even deeper,’ she said.

The Chinese president arrived in Dhaka on Friday morning on a state visit to help usher in a new era in Dhaka-Beijing relations.

President Abdul Hamid received his Chinese counterpart on his arrival at the VVIP terminal of Hazrat Shahjalal international airport 12:03pm amid a booming 21-gun salute.

Meanwhile, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia is scheduled to meet Xi Jinping on at the presidential suite of Le Meridian Hotel at 5:00pm.

A BNP leader close to Khaleda said a six-member BNP delegation, including party secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, standing committee members Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, Mahbubur Rahman, Nazrul Islam Khan, chairperson’s advisers Reaz Rahman and Sabihuddin Ahmed, will accompany Khaleda.

During the meeting, he said, the BNP chief will discuss a wide range of issues relating to the bilateral interests, Bangladesh’s latest political situation and next general election.
