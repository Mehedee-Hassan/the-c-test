Sheeran settles Photograph copyright infringement claim
Ed Sheeran has settled a $20m (£13.8m) copyright infringement claim against him in the US, over his hit song Photograph, reports BBC Entertainment.

Songwriters Thomas Leonard and Martin Harrington sued the singer last June, claiming his hit ballad had a similar structure to their song, Amazing.

A lawyer for the pair confirmed to the BBC the claim had now been settled.

Leonard and Harrington’s track was released by former X Factor winner Matt Cardle in 2012.

On Friday, court papers were lodged dismissing the case ‘with prejudice’, stipulating that a California federal court would enforce the terms of an agreement.

Richard Busch, who represented Harrington and Leonard, would not comment on the settlement terms.

A spokeswoman for Sheeran’s record company, Atlantic Records, told the BBC it did not comment on stories relating to copyright issues.

The songwriters originally claimed the chorus of the two songs shared 39 identical notes, with similarities ‘instantly recognisable to the ordinary observer’.

They submitted the chord structures for both tracks in court documents.
