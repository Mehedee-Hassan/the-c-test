Bangladesh’s young batsman Mosaddek Hossain kept his reputation of scoring heavy runs in the domestic arena intact as he made the first century of the Dhaka Premier Division League on Wednesday.

The 21-year old Mosaddek, who has been shining in the international arena over the last twelve months, made 110 to help defending champions Abahani Limited make a winning start.

Newly promoted Khelaghar SKS made a challenging 293-6 but Moasaddek’s 85-ball belligerent innings along with a half century of skipper Mahmudullah helped Abahani win the match by five wickets with 15 balls to spare at Fatullah.

Abahani made a poor start in the chase as they lost their opener Saif Hasan in the second ball of the innings for a golden duck but his partner Sadman Islam and Nazmul Hossain added 82 runs in the second wicket stand to control the damage.

Both batsmen were sent back to the pavilion in the space of three runs and seven balls to leave the champions on 85-3 in 18.2 overs.

But Mosaddek and Mahmudullah, two dependable middle order batsmen, made a 127-run stand off 124 balls to keep them on the chase.

Mahmudullah, who had committed to join Legends of Rupganj but joined Abahani at the last moment, made 59 off 67 with three fours and two sixes before he was out in the first ball of 40th over.

Mosaddek, however, kept on before he was eventually dismissed in the 48th over after hitting 12 fours and two sixes.

Mosaddek and Mahmuduallh were the instrumental in the Abahani’s win but it was Mohammad Mithun’s swashbuckling innings that ultimately helped them finish with the win.

Mithun made 42 off just 27 balls with four fours and a six and made a rapid-fire 81-run fifth wicket stand off just 49 balls with Mosaddek to make the win look easy.

Befittingly it was Mithun, who struck the boundary in the very next ball of Mosaddek’s dismissal to finish the game.

Sadekur Rahman Tazin good 2-36 for Khelaghar.

Mosaddek said after the match he was confident to finish the match.

‘I did not feel the pressure. I am comfortable batting in those situations. I was confident I could finish the match. I exactly did that. I played till the end.

‘Me and Riyad [Mahmudullah] vai planned to play till 40 overs and play aggressively in last 10 overs, we exactly did it,’ said Mosaddek.

Earlier in the day Khaleghar skipper Nafees Iqbal, who made 78 off 85 balls, made a 149-run stand with Robiul Islam Robi (74) in the second wicket to give his side a good platform.

Amit Majumder, Nazim Uddin and Masum Khan made 41, 37 and 31 respectively to take the score close to 300-mark but in the end that proved inadequate for the newcomers.

Mohammad Saifuddin, who made his international debut in a Twenty20 international at Sri Lanka in last week, was the pick of the bowlers for winners with a figure of 3-45.
