An 11-day children’s book fair and cultural show, marking national children’s day, is underway on Bangladesh Shishu Academy premises.

State minister for women and children’s affairs Meher Afroz Chumki inaugurated the event on Thursday. Among others, popular writer Muhammad Zafar Iqbal, poet Kazi Rosy and women and children’s affairs secretary Nasima Begum were present as special guests at the inaugural programme. Chairman of the academy Selina Hossain presided over the event.

‘Alongside textbooks children must also read different types of books. By reading books children can know about things or places they have never seen or been to. Books can also ignite the imagination of the young minds,’ Muhammad Zafar Iqbal said at the programme.

Fifty publication houses are participating at the book fair featuring books written for children. Apart from story books there are also books written on history, culture and more.

Child artistes of different cultural organisations will stage cultural programmes at Shaheed Matiur Rahman Mukta Mancha of Bangladesh Shishu Academy during the event.

The fair will remain open till March 26.
