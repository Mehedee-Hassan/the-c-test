Thirty-five leading artists are displaying their works at Zainul Gallery in Dhaka University as part of a fundraising show ahead of Pahela Baishakh.

The event, which features 35 art works of diverse subjects and styles by artists like Rafiqun Nabi, Samarjit Roy Chowdhury, Biren Shome, Abdus Shakoor Shah, Jamal Ahmed, Alakesh Ghosh, Abdul Mannan, Shamsuddoha, Shishir Bhattacharjee, Ranjit Das and others, aims to generate funds for the Mangal Shobhajatra procession of FFA.

Landscape paintings by Alakesh Ghosh, Abdul Mannan and Shamsuddoha depict scenic beauty of rural Bangladesh.

Jamal Ahmed’s painting shows a woman with a pigeon. Shishir Bhattacharjee has painted a tiger in his signature style.

The displayed artworks were produced at a daylong art camp held at FFA on April 4. Cultural affairs minister Asaduzzaman Noor inaugurated the exhibition on Monday. Among others, DU vice-chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique and dean of faculty of fine arts professor Nisar Hossain were present on the occasion.

‘Every year FFA raises funds for Mangal Shobhajatra by selling artworks prepared by its teachers and students. A number of the displayed art works have already been sold. We are hopeful that all the art works will be sold out’, Nisar Hossain told New Age.

Cultural affairs minister praised the faculty’s preparations for Mangal Shobhajatra. The faculty is going to organise a grand Mangal Shobhajatra this year following its declaration as an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO in 2016.

‘Mangal Shobhajatra has become synonymous to secular Bangladesh. It is a procession which brings people of all religions and classes together’, said Asaduzzaman Noor who also visited the students working on puppets and others on faculty of fine art premise.

The show will be open till April 13.
