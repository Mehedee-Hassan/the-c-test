Facebook starts deactivating fake accounts
The Facebook authorities on Friday announced that it has started deactivating fake accounts including those created in Bangladesh.

The company has been fighting the spam operation for six months, Shabnam Shaik, a technical program manager at Facebook, wrote in a post on its security blog Friday.

‘The accounts Facebook found were made to appear as if they were located in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and a number of other countries’, Shaik wrote.

Meanwhile, many Bangladesh authentic users of Facebook said their accounts could not be traced out.

According to ‘We Are Social and Hootsuite’ April 2017 report, Dhaka has the second highest Facebook users among global cities with 2.2 crore active users.

Mohammad Ibrahim, a private farm executive in Karwan Bazar said he could not log on his account from Saturday morning.

‘Upon arriving at office, I tried to log on my Facebook account but failed’, he said.

Asaduzzaman from Natore said his friends informed him on Saturday that his account could not be found.

‘Later I could retrieve my account after providing some answer to the auto-generated questions of Facebook’, he said.
