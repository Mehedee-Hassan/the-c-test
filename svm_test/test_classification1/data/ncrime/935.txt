LipIce to host Smile On Tour
‘Smile On Tour' is a new campaign by LipIce which has commenced from January 17. The tour will conclude on February 14 with a Valentine's Day gala and dinner. The aim of the tour is to put a smile across the face of your loved ones and wish them a wonderful Valentine. The loved one can be a parent, a sibling, a friend or a special someone.

The rules of participation are simple. You have to mention your most beloved person, write a message to them and share the message on LipIce's Facebook page. Alongside Facebook, the campaign will tour shopping malls, super shops, universities and corporate offices where there will be a wishing tree. Participants have to write a message to their loved ones, which will later be hung on the tree. Then, with the wishing tree and their message as the background, one must take a selfie and upload it to LipIce's Facebook page to earn a LipIce picture souvenir.

Two winners will be picked every week. After four weeks, the eight chosen messages will be declared winners, each receiving LipIce's attractive gift hampers. The winners will also be able to attend the LipIce's Valentine's Day gala and dinner. The Valentine's Day gala will feature surprise celebrities and models who will sit with the winners of the tour.

So wish your loved one through LipIce Smile On Tour and have a wonderful time this coming Valentine's Day!
