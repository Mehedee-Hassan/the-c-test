Cyber Tribunal has no jurisdiction during investigation
The High Court Division in a full verdict has said that the Cyber Tribunal was not authorized to entertain bail petitions in information and communication technology related cases until it took the charges into cognizance and the police submitted their probe reports.

The text of the 28-page verdict was released Wednesday while the short verdict was delivered on March 23 by a bench of Justice Md Miftah Uddin Choudhury and Justice ANM Bashir Ullah.

The bench also ruled that the Information and Communication Technology Act imposed no embargoes on magistrates’ courts, session’s courts and the High Court Division to hear bail petitions in ICT cases.

The bench asked the High Court Division registrar to send copies of the full verdict to the cyber tribunal as well as the session’s courts and to all the chief metropolitan magistrates and the chief judicial magistrates.

In the brief verdict the bench had granted bails to Md Sabuj Ahmed alias Ahmed Shamim Sabuj in a case in which he was accused of posting comments on the father of the nation, the prime minister, her family members and Rabindranath Tagore.

Sabuj moved the HC after the chief judicial magistrate’s court in Magura, and later the district’s session’s court did not entertain his bail petition.

Later, the cyber tribunal also rejected his bail petition.

The bench said in the verdict that the cyber tribunal had committed an illegality by entertaining the bail petition of Sabuj at the investigation stage.

The bench also said that the session’s court in Magura committed a illegality by returning the bail petition of Sabuj and referring it to the cyber tribunal.

The case against Sabuj was filed by Mohammadpur unit Chhatra League joint convener Md Al Imran on September 10,2016.

Since arrest on November 15, 2016, Sabuj has been in jail custody.
