A still from documentary Meherunnesa.

A documentary on martyred poet Meherunnesa will be aired on private television channel My TV tomorrow at 8:10pm.

Riaz Mahmud Mithu has made the 22-minute documentary titled ‘Meherunnesa’, which was aired on ATN Bangla on Wednesday and had its premiere show at Liberation War Museum on March 25.

Meherunnesa was brutally killed on March 27, 1971 at her residence in Mirpur, Dhaka. The documentary is the first documentary on Meherunnesa, said to be the first martyred poet during the liberation war.

Produced jointly by Green University of Bangladesh and Shapnokola Cultural Bhubon Foundation, the documentary depicts life and works of Meherunnesa, whose family moved to the then East Pakistan from Kolkata in 1947.

Meherunnesa started writing poems from her early childhood days. Most of her writings, written between the years 1954 and 1971, were published in the then weekly Begum.

Besides writing poems, Meherunnesa also took part in the mass upsurge of 1969 as a member of the action committee formed in Mirpur.

When the flag of Bangladesh was hoisted in Mirpur on 23 March 1971, Meherunnesa also raised the flag at her residence.

‘Meherunnesa was the first martyred intellectual of the country but no documentary has been made on her till date. I fascinated about making a documentary on her and finally finished it’, Riaz Mahmud Mithu told New Age.
