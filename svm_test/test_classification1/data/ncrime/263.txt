Seasoned film actor-director Razzak demands for establishment of a film centre in presence of information minister Hasanul Haque Inu at Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy on Saturday.

Actor Syed Hasan Imam, film directors Morshedul Islam, Mashiuddin Shaker, Mushfiqur Rahman Gulzar, Nasiruddin Yousuff and former Bangladesh Film Archives director general Jahangir Hossain, among others, were present.

The speakers said that though film was a powerful medium, there was no permanent or separate platform where filmmakers, critiques and audience could gather and share their thoughts and philosophies about film.

They also said that a film centre which existed in almost all the countries became a necessity of time as it could unite all film enthusiasts under one roof.

It was further proposed that the centre should include three auditoriums having 700, 300 and 150 seats. The film activists also proposed the inclusion of a 150 seat seminar hall, audio-visual library, cafeteria and allocation of five rooms for film societies at the centre.

The minister assured them that the he would look into the matter and take necessary steps as soon as possible. Inu added that he would talk to prime minister Sheikh Hasina as soon as she returns from India.
