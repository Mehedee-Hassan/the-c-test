Chhayanaut hosts classical dance fest
Dhrity Nrityalaya artistes present a Manipuri dance recital at Chhayanaut on Friday.

A classical dance festival featuring group and individual performances was organised by Chhayanaut at its auditorium in Dhaka on Friday.

Recitals based on major classical dance forms including Kathak, Bharatnatyam, Manipuri, Odissi and Gaudiya were presented at the event titled ‘Chhayanaut Nritya Utsab.’

In total, there were eight group performances by eight troupes as well as nine solo performances at the event, which began with a welcome speech by Mafidul Haq, one of the trustees of the Liberation War Museum.

The first performance was based on Manipuri, a dance genre named after the north-eastern Indian state of Manipur in which it originated.

Noted dancers Sharmila Bandopadhyay and Sonia Rashid, along with a group of students of Chhayanaut, presented a piece that came with all the typical features of Manipuri including slow-paced movements.

The dancers rendered Radhika Rup Pareng, a dance piece depicting how Radha would prepare herself including wearing make-up before meeting Krishna, her lover and a Hindu God.

The artistes of Dhriti Nrityalay, led by noted dancer Warda Rihab, entertained the audience with an eye-catching performance based on Manipuri in which they danced with sticks.

Noted dancer Rachal Priyanka Paris presented a routine based on Gaudiya, widely regarded as a classical dance form of Bengal.

Meanwile, Munmun Ahmed and her troupe performed Kathak dance at the event, presenting tarana – a musical composition. Their performance, which involved a lot of foot works and facial expressions, created a joyous atmosphere in the hall. Noted Bharatnatyam dancer Amit Chowdhury presented a solo performance based on Shiva Padam, a devotional piece. It is meant to be a prayer for blessings from Shiva, the most prominent of Hindu Gods.

The festival was attended by a large crowd.
