DCCI worried about India’s anti-dumping duty on jute
The Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Saturday expressed its concern over imposition of anti-dumping duty by the Indian government on import of jute and jute goods from Bangladesh.

Terming the decision ‘iniquitous treatment’ of the finance ministry of the Indian government, the DCCI said that the anti-dumping duty imposition could put adverse multiplier impacts on Bangladesh’s local growers, producers, exporters and spur further trade imbalance of Bangladesh with India.

‘DCCI is concerned about the iniquitous treatment of the Ministry of Finance, Government of India on our jute which will have negative cascading impacts on parties involved in our local jute supply chain process, export market and dampen glorious heritage of golden fibre of Bangladesh, as a whole our $6.5 billion bilateral trade,’ the trade body said in a statement.

Bangladesh, despite being the largest export destination of India in South Asia, is working hard to improve and maintain a justified cross-border bilateral trade relation with India and this sort of decision is likely to be a blow to our endeavour, it said.

The DCCI urged commerce ministry, finance ministry, Bangladesh Tariff Commission and other agencies concerned to immediately take up the issue to dismantle the decision of anti-dumping duty and negotiate with India to refrain the finance ministry of India from taking this sort of trade-unfriendly decision in order to safeguard Bangladesh’s jute industry.
