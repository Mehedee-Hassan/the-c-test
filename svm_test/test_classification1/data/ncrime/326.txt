BAFA remembers Bulbul Chy
BAFA artistes present a dance recital at Shawkat Osman Memorial Auditorium of Central Public Library on Monday.

Bulbul Academy of Fine Arts celebrated the 98th birth anniversary of its founder and legendary dancer Bulbul Chowdhury through a programme at the Shawkat Osman Memorial Auditorium of Central Public Library on Monday.

Bulbul Chowdhury, originally known as Rashid Ahmed Chowdhury, was born on January 1, 1919 and died on May 17, 1954.

The commemorative programme featured a culture show while awards were given to the winners of a BAFA competition in music, painting, dance and instrument.

A total of 225 winners from the 11 branches of the academy received awards.

BAFA has recently introduced 43 awards named after its dead teachers including Ustad Barin Majumder, Ustad M Hossain Khasru, Ustad Munsi Raisuddin, Abdul Ahad, Ajit Roy, Sohrab Hossain, Murad Ali, and Atiqul Islam.

The idea is to recognise the most promising students of the academy. Comptroller and auditor general Masud Ahmed handed over these awards to the recipients at the programme.

Following the awards ceremony, the winning students entertained the audience with both solo and group performances.

They presented patriotic songs and popular numbers by Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam and several eminent folk bards.

There were also a few dance recitals including a group one based on the Indian classical dance form of Kathak.
