Tagore exponent Waheedul Haque’s 84th birth anniversary was observed by two organisations, founded by Haque, at different venues in the capital on Thursday.

Recitation organisation Kanthasilan paid tribute to Haque through a programme held at Shawkat Osman Memorial Auditorium of Central Public Library and Nalanda, a school foundered by Haque, organised an exhibition at Chhayanaut Bhaban in Dhanmondi.

Kanthasilan’s programme featured discussion and poetry recitation by the artistes of the organisation.

Among others, noted poet Muhammad Samad and president of Kanthasilan Golam Sarwar spoke on the occasion.

‘Waheedul Haque is still among us through the organisations he had founded. He left behind many followers,’ said Muhammad Samad.

Golam Sarwar said that the present day cultural arena is indebted to Haque because of his immense contributions.

The speakers recalled Haque who was a man of many qualities. He was a journalist, singer, academician and organiser. He played an important role during the 1971 Liberation War by founding the Swadhin Bangla Shilpi Sangstha.

After the discussion a recitation production titled ‘Amar Janmobhumi’ – a compilation of songs and poems on Language Movement and Liberation War – was staged at the venue.

Artistes of Kanthasilan recited Atulprasad Sen’s Amori Bangla Bhasa, Abdul Hakim’s Je Sob Bangete Janme, Mahadev Saha’s Ekusher Gaan, Abdul Latif’s Daam Diye Kinechhi Bangla and others as part of the production directed by Ila Rahman.

Nalanda’s ongoing exhibition at Chhayanaut Bhaban features essays, poems, short stories and drawings by the students of the school. The event will remain open for all from 4pm to 7pm everyday till March 22. Nalanda will also hold a two-day cultural event at Chhayanaut auditorium on March 19 and 20 as tribute to Waheedul Haque.
