HC rejects tanners’ petition seeking time until Eid-ul-Azha
The High Court on Wednesday rejected a petition of tannery owners to allow them to run their factories at Hazaribagh in Dhaka until the next Eid-ul-Azha.

The order cleared the way for the Department of Environment to snap the utility services to the tanneries and shut down their all kinds of operations at Hazaribagh.

The bench of Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed and Justice Md Salim passed the order after hearing the petition filed by the Tanners’ Association against the High Court March 6 order.

The High Court on March 6 asked the government to shut down all the tanneries at Hazaribagh immediately as they missed several deadlines for relocation to Tannery Industrial Park at Savar.

The High Court also ordered immediate cut-off of utility services, including gas, power and water supply, to the tanneries.

The court asked the Department of Environment director general to report the compliance with the order by April 6.

It also asked the secretaries of home and industries, inspector general of police and Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner to cooperate with the department to shut down the tanneries.

The High Court on July 15, 2001 directed the government and the tanners to relocate the tanneries by February 28, 2010.
