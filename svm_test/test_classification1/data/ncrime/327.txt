Today is the second death anniversary of the late filmmaker Chashi Nazrul Islam, who earned popularity by making critically and popularly acclaimed films including those on the 1971 Liberation War.

Chashi Nazrul Islam (October 23, 1941 - January 11, 2015) made his debut as director through the epoch-making war film Ora Egaro Jon in 1972 – the first film on the 1971 war and also the first feature film released after the independence of the country.

For his long service to the film industry, he won a number of awards and accolades including the Ekushey Padak in 1994.

He directed 22 films and won the National Film Award twice as best director in 1986 and 1997.
