No plan to block viber, imo, whatsapp, skype says BTRC
Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission on Tuesday said it has no plan to block or restrict the free calling and social communication apps like viber, imo, whatsapp, skype in the country.

‘Besides, the government didn't issue any directive to the telecom regulator to block this OTT (over-the-top) or communication apps,’ said the regulator in a media statement.



Referring to some media reports and publicity in social networking sites saying that BTRC is mulling to block those apps, the regulator termed those as ‘misleading’. ‘Those reports and publicity are totally false and baseless,’ it added.



On November 25, the BTRC Chairman at a press conference talked about the role of such type of apps in diverting legal international call to the country and their future plan of examining the policy of different countries for handling those apps.



The BTRC said, ‘No question was raised at the press conference for blocking the voice call using OTT apps.’ But, some media reports and Talk Show are trying to shift the responsibility to BTRC of blocking those apps which is totally unexpected, added the BTRC statement.
