The prices of hilsa increased sharply in the city’s kitchen markets the day before Pahela Baishakh, the opening day of Bangla new year, that falls on April 14 (today).

The prices of hilsa increased by Tk 100-350 a kilogram in last two days, traders said.

The demand for hilsa remains very high ahead of the festival as a huge number of the fish are consumed on the occasion.

Against the backdrop, the government this year has launched an awareness programme across the country not to consume hilsa on Pahela Baishakh with the aim of protecting hilsa fry.

Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on April 11 urged the people of the country to leave hilsa off the Pahela Baishakh menu and add fresh ones to it on the day.

The prices of garlic and onion also went up in last two days as the demand for the items soared ahead of Pahela Baishakh.

Traders, however, said the turnout of buyers of hilsa this year was lower than that of last year due to the government campaign.

‘The supply of hilsa to the market is abundant and the turnout of buyers is lower this year,’ Md Piara, a hilsa trader at the Mohammadpur Krishi Market, told New Age on Thursday.

The prices of hilsa weighing around 500-800 grams increased by Tk 100-200 a kg while the item weighing around 900 grams to 1.2 kg increased by Tk 300-350 a kg in the city’s kitchen markets.

A hilsa weighing around 500 grams to 650 grams was selling at Tk 800 to Tk 900 a kg while a hilsa weighing around 700 grams to 800 grams was selling at Tk 1,000-1,400 a piece at the Hatirpool kitchen market on Thursday.

A piece of hilsa weighing 900 grams to 1.2 kg was selling at Tk 2,000-2,600 on the day.

Md Sharif, a hilsa trader at the Hatirpool kitchen market, said that the business of hilsa ahead of this Pahela Baishakh was not satisfactory.

The supply of hilsa was huge at the market but the customers for the item were lower than expected, he said.

The prices of other fish remained unchanged. Rohita was selling at Tk 200-250 a kg, katla at Tk 220-350 a kg, pangas at Tk 120-280 a kg and tilapia at Tk 120-160 a kg, depending on their size and quality.

The prices of onion increased by Tk 5 a kg and the item was selling at Tk 25-38 a kg, while its imported variety at Tk 25 a kg on Thursday.

Garlic prices increased by Tk 10 a kg and the imported garlic was selling at Tk 190-200 a kg while the local variety was retailing at Tk 110-130 a kg in the city’s kitchen markets on the day.
