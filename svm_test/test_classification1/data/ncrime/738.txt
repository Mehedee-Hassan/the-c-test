Bangladesh Rice Research Institute has developed three new high productive rice varieties, which can be cultivated in Aman season.

MA Kashem, technical editor and head of publications and public relations division at BRRI, said National Seed Board on April 5, provided permission to cultivate these varieties in different areas of the country.

Among the newly released varieties, BRRI dhan 79 is flash flood tolerant and can survive 18-21 days of submergence, he said adding that if it does not have to face such lengthy submergence it can ensure seven ton of rice on per hectare field.

BRRI dhan 52, BRRI dhan 69 can provide 4.5-5.0 tonnes rice per hectare field if it gets proper care, he said.

It has been sent to Dhaka, Chittagong and Jessore regions farmers for cultivation which can be cultivated in both Aman and Boro season, he added.

Its life cycle completes within 115 to 120 days, he said.
