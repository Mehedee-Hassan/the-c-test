Water resources minister Anisul Islam Mahmud on Wednesday said the much expected Teesta agreement was finalized to be inked ‘any time’ but declined to comment if it could be signed during prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s New Delhi visit.

‘I can’t tell you if the deal would be signed during her (upcoming) visit . . . but we are hopeful about the agreement,’ he told newsmen on the sidelines of a programme.

Water resources ministry staged the programme coinciding with ‘World Water Day-2017’ at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre here when he said Bangladesh simultaneously was trying to construct a barrage on the Ganges to preserve water for dry season involving India.

The minister reiterated Bangladesh’s expectation for an immediate deal on the long pending issue of the cross-border Teesta river with India but simultaneously reminded all of the obstacles on its way due to internal political issues of the neighbouring country.

State minister of the ministry Muhammad Nazrul Islam and chief coordinator of SDGs Md Abul Kalam Azad addressed the function as special guests.

Senior secretary of the ministry Dr Zafar Ahmed Khan chaired the function.
