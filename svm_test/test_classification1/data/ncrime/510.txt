Lack of Bangladeshi leggie surprises Afghan Rahmat
Rahmat Shah

Afghanistan all-rounder Rahmat Shah said on Monday that he was surprised to see dearth of leg spinners in Bangladesh though he believed there are potentials.

Rahmat, a middle-order batsman and a leg-break bowler, joined Mohammedan Sporting Club for the forthcoming edition on Dhaka Premier League.

Rahmat, who played for Mohammedan earlier in DPL on two more occasions, keeps a good knowledge of the condition and the ability of local cricketers.

While Afghanistan produced promising leg-spinner Rashid Khan, Bangladesh lacked the presence of bowler of similar caliber in both national team and at domestic level.

‘There is nothing like here the wicket doesn’t suit leg spinners,’ Rahmat told reporters at Mirpur.

‘There are some leg spinners and now you need to keep your patience with them,’ he said.

‘I think a leg spinner grows with time and the way he prepares him taking all the workload.

‘It is a very difficult art to master but if you can do that and have the required support structure you are sure to shine,’ he said.

In recent past Jubair Hossain was considered to have the potential of

turning out to be a good

leg-spinner though he failed to keep up the promise.

His expensive bowling literally made him unwanted in the domestic circuit, though he was picked up by Mohammedan this season.

Despite a promising start for defending champions Abahani in the first match of the last season the young leggie could manage to appear for only seven matches picking 12 wickets.

Another leg-spinner Tanvir Haider, who was called in the national fold in their New Zealand tour, also could not make any long lasting impact.
