The Bangla version of Canadian filmmaker Cathy Stevulak’s award-winning documentary on the ancient indigenous art of Nakshi Kantha, ‘THREADS’, was screened at Bangladesh National Museum in the city on Sunday.

Cultural affairs minister Asaduzzaman Noor was present at the screening session as the chief guest.

‘THREADS’ is an intimate portrait of 85-year-old Nakshi Kantha artiste, Surayia Rahman, who transformed the quilt-work tradition of kantha to create possibilities for a better life for her family and hundreds of destitute women in Bangladesh.

Over three decades, as their art becomes prized possessions of connoisseurs around the world, Surayia Rahman and the artisans overcome their hardships with the needle and the thread, stitch by stitch.

Enayetullah Khan, also Editor-in-Chief of UNB, is the executive producer of the Bangala version of the documentary, said a press release.

Cosmos Foundation arranged the screening event.

The original version of ‘THREADS’ won three international awards participating in two festivals, including Female Eye Film Festival, Toronto and Friday Harbor Film Festival.

Catherine Masud is the co-producer of the documentary while late Mishuk Munier is the cinematographer.

A private screening of the film was held at the residence of Enayetullah Khan in the city’s Baridhara area on Saturday where many academics, diplomats, artists, journalists and entrepreneurs were present.
