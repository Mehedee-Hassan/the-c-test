Theatre personality Shimul Yousuf was felicitated by her peers and colleagues on her 60th birthday at a programme at the open field of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy on Tuesday.

Theatre personality Ramendu Majumdar and Ataur Rahman, singer Subir Nandi, recitation artistes Ashraful Alam and Rupa Chakraborty, director general of Shilpakala Academy Liaquat Ali Lucky, dancer Tamanna Rahman and many others were present at the programme.

Subir Nandi rendered a DL Roy’s song Maha Sindhur Opar Hate in honour of Shimul Yousuf at the programme.

Ataur Rahman recited his self-penned poem Mancher Udbhasita Gaurab for Shimul Yousuf.

Expressing her feelings, Shimul Yousuf said that she was grateful to the organisers for the splendid programme. Besides, she also remembered recently demised Kolkata-based singer Kalika Prasad in her speech saying that Kalika devoted his life in search of the root-level song.
