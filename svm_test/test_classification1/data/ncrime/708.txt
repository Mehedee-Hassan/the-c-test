Dhaka to go under security blanket during Pahela Baishakh
Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Asaduzzaman Miah on Tuesday said a foolproof security plan has been taken for Pahela Baishakh, the first day of Bangla New Year, to be celebrated on April 14 next.

‘Every inch of Dhaka University, Ramna and Suhrawardy Udyan will be brought under CCTV surveillance,’ said the DMP commissioner while briefing reporters at DMP media centre.

Asaduzzaman said around 11,000 uniformed policemen along with plainclothes ones will be deployed for ensuring security during the celebrations though there is no specific security alert for this year's Pahela Baishakh.

The revelers will have to join the Mangal Shobhajatra rally from the starting point as no one will be allowed to join it from any middle point, he said. ‘Police will escort the rally,’ Asaduzzaman added.

However, the programmes to be held at open spaces in Dhaka University area have been asked to shut by 6:00pm. ‘Elsewhere in Dhaka, those will have to be shut by 5:00pm.’
