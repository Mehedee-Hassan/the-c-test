EPZ, EZ cos must repatriate earnings to B’desh within 4 months
Bangladesh Bank on Tuesday said the industries located in the country’s export processing and economic zones would also have to repatriate to the country their earnings from their exports through land routes within four months of shipment.

The BB issued a circular to authorised dealer branches of all banks asking them to follow the directive to repatriate the export earnings in line with the Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Transactions-2009.

The guidelines also asked the banks to repatriate the export earnings within four months from the date of shipment through air and water ways.

A BB official told New Age on Tuesday that the guidelines mention no timeframe for repatriation of the proceeds of exports through land routes.

For this reason, the central bank has clarified the matter issuing the circular and that would also be applicable for the industries located in EPZs and EZs, he said.
