Khaleda to meet Xi Jinping on Friday
Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson Khaleda Zia will meet Chinese president Xi Jinping on Friday evening at a city hotel in Khilkhet area.



‘BNP chairperson will meet the Chinese president at the presidential suite of Le Meridian Hotel at 5:00pm on Friday,’ her press secretary Maruf Kamal Khan Sohel said on Thursday.



The Chinese president is scheduled to arrive here on Friday morning on a 22-hour state visit. The visit is taking place three decades after Chinese president Li Xiannian visited Bangladesh in March 1986.



The Chinese president also will have significant talks with president Abdul Hamid and prime minister Sheikh Hasina, and important deals on a number of mega projects involving several billion dollars are likely to be signed during the visit.



A BNP leader close to Khaleda said a six-member BNP delegation, including party secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, standing committee members Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, Mahbubur Rahman, Nazrul Islam Khan, chairperson’s advisers Reaz Rahman and Sabihuddin Ahmed, will accompany Khaleda.



During the meeting, he said the BNP chief will discuss a wide rage of issues relating to the bilateral interests, Bangladesh’s latest political situation and next general election.



Earlier in the day, BNP standing committee member Gayeshwar Chandra Roy at a programme hoped that the Chinese president’s tour will produce positive outcomes for the country protecting mutual interests of the two friendly nations.



‘We welcome his tour, but don’t know with which offers the Chinese president is coming or what our country is seeking from him. We’re completely in the dark, but we hope it’ll bring good for the county,’ the BNP leader said.
