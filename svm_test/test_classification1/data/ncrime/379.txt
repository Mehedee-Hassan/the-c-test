NGOs take lion shares
Namita Chakraborty with her works

Artisan Namita Chakraborty earns bread and butter selling decorative items made from cloths depicting images of scenic beauty, animals, birds and images of popular landmarks.

She also makes and paints small ornaments and souvenirs.

To make her décor items, Namita follows the technique and style of the traditional pata chitra (scroll painting) that she learned from her late husband Raghunath Chakraborty, who got popularity as a pata chitra artist.

In an interview with New Age, Namita, who participated at the craft fair held on Sonargaon Museum premises in February, talked about her art works and life struggles.

A resident of Bashubazar in Old Dhaka, Namita said her life struggles intensified with the death of her husband Raghunath in 2015.

‘I started to work hard as an artisan after death of my husband to maintain my family and also to continue his legacy. When he was alive, we did not have to worry about selling the products,’ Namita said.

But, she said, she faces problems marketing her products.

‘My financial condition is not very good. I also don’t have proper platform to sell my goods. As a result, I sell decors to the NGOs and they take the lion shares of the profit.’

‘Sometimes, I sell decors in different fairs but fairs are not permanent platforms and I can’t afford to rent a shop of my own at a good location,’ Namita said.

She also added that there are other traditional artisans in her area and they are also facing the same problems as her.

‘The government can help us by giving us shops on rent at state owned shopping complexes in good locations. If that happens then we would have a permanent platform to sell our goods and therefore be able to support our family,’ observed Namita.
