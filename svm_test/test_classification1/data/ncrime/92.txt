Meat traders’ strike ends
Meat traders will set their next course of action today as their six-day strike in the Dhaka city ended on Saturday.

Bangladesh Meat Traders Association and Dhaka Metropolitan Meat Traders Association jointly enforced the strike from Monday to press home their demands.

Their demands include end to extortion at the Gabtoli cattle market and hassle-free cattle import from India, Nepal and other neighbouring countries.

Bangladesh Meat Traders Association secretary general Rabiul Alam told New Age on Saturday that they would go for a non-stop countrywide strike if their demands were not met.

Today (Sunday) leaders of the meat traders will meet commerce minister Tofail Ahmed and Dhaka North City Corporation authorities for resolving the issue.

The city people might not get meat on Sunday as the traders do not slaughter any animal on Sundays to observe the day as meat-free day in every week, Rabiul said.

BMTA leaders said that they could sell beef at Tk 300 a kilogram instead of Tk 500 unless they had to face extortions.

According to meat traders, as per rules they pay Tk 50 a cow, Tk 70 a buffalo and Tk 15 a sheep or a goat as market toll on condition that they will sell the meat at the open market while general people have to pay 3.5 per cent on

the price of an animal as toll.

The traders alleged that the authorities did not follow the rule and were charging high. Cattle market leaseholder Lutfar Rahman, however, denied the allegation.
