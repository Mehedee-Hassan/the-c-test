Sonia assures PM of their common stand on Bangladesh
Indian National Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday assured prime minister Sheikh Hasina of taking a common stand of all political parties of India regarding next-door neighbour Bangladesh.

‘There may have political differences among us... but our stance is same with regards to our relations with Bangladesh,’ she said during a courtesy call on prime minister Sheikh Hasina at Rashtrapati Bhaban in India’s capital New Delhi Sunday evening.

Briefing reporters after the meeting, PM’s press secretary Ihsanul Karim said that Sonia Gandhi had appreciated the culmination of the land boundary agreement between the two countries which was initiated by the Congress-led UPA government.

The prime minister shared with Sonia Gandhi her stride for socioeconomic uplift of Bangladesh. Sonia highly praised Bangladesh’s socioeconomic growth, the press secretary said.

As Sheikh Hasina highlighted the steps taken by her government to clamp down on extremism and terrorism, Sonia said that the menaces should be contained with an iron hand.

Former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi accompanied Sonia Gandhi.

Foreign minister AH Mahmood Ali, Bangladesh high commissioner to India Syed Moazzem Ali, PM’s principal secretary Kamal Abdul Naser Chowdhury, foreign secretary Shahidul Haque and Awami League presidium member Kazi Zafarullah were present.
