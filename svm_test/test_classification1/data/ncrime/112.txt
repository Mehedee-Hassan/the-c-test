The Supreme Court on Thursday issued a rule saying that the process of holding election to the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry can continue until the next hearing.

Chamber Judge of the Appellate Division Syed Mahmud Hossain came up with the rule after a hearing on a petition filed by the FBCCI against an HC order that stayed the process of holding the election for two months.

Attorney general Mahabubey Alam, lawyers Kamrul Haque Siddique, and Imtiaz Moinul Islam stood for FBCCI, while lawyers M Badruddoza Badal and Rokonuddin Mahmud for the petitioner.

The chamber Judge also sent the petition to a regular bench of the Appellate Division and fixed March 27 for the next hearing, said Badruddoza Badal.

The election is scheduled to be held on May 14. The FBCCI announced the schedule on February 14.

On Wednesday, the HC stayed for two months the election after a hearing on a writ petition filed on February 6 by Aminul Haque Shamim, president of Mymensingh Chamber of Commerce and Industry, seeking a stay on the process allowing the MCCI to get enlisted in the FBBCI voter list.
