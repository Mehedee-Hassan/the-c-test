SC to hear Khaleda's plea in Niko case Oct 31
Chamber judge of the Appellate Division on Sunday sent a leave to appeal petition of BNP chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia in connection with Niko graft case to the regular bench for hearing.

‘The chamber judge sent the matter to the regular bench, which is scheduled to hear the

matter on October 31,’ said Khaleda's lawyer Ragib Rouf Chowdhury.

The High Court on June 18, 2015, passed an order paving way for continuation of the graft

case against the BNP leader before the trial court. The HC division bench comprising justice Md Nuruzzaman and justice Zafar Ahmed passed the order while disposing of a rule issued earlier in this regard.

Khaleda on December 7, 2015, filed a leave to appeal plea against that High Court order.

The Anti Corruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon police station on December 9, 2007. The ACC on May 5, 2008, submitted charge-sheet against 11 people including Khaleda Zia.

Accepting a petition filed by Khaleda, the HC on July 9, 2008, stayed the case proceedings and issued a rule, asking for explanation as to why the case proceedings against her shall not be declared illegal.
