Dhaka stocks end flat amid topsy-turvy trading
Amid volatility, Dhaka stocks finished flat on Thursday, the last trading session of the week, with decline in share prices of most traded scrips amid increase in share prices of some large capitalised scrips, saving the market from significant fall.

The key index of Dhaka Stock Exchange, DSEX, finished at 5,625.33 points, shedding just 0.50 points after increase of 42 points in last two trading sessions.

Breaking last two trading sessions’ positive vibe, the market ended flat but on the negative trajectory with decline in share prices of most traded scrips, stockbrokers said.

Investors’ profit booking share sales was the main reason behind the negative decline in share prices of most traded scrips, they said.

Prices of 164 scrips out of the traded 328 companies and mutual funds declined, while 126 advanced and 38 remained unchanged.

Despite the decline in share prices of most traded scrips, the market finished flat mainly due to rise in share prices of some large capitalised scrips, stockbrokers said.

On the sectoral front, average prices of non-bank financial institutions and energy scrips rose by 1 per cent and 0.70 per cent respectively.

On the other hand, prices of bank and telecommunication shares fell by 1.42 per cent and 1.28 per cent on an average respectively.

DS30, the blue-chip index of the bourse, inched up 0.13 per cent or 2.73 points, to close at 2,036.19 points on Thursday.

The Shariah index, DSES, fell 0.27 per cent or 3.66 points, to close at 1,309.48 points.

Turnover on the bourse increased to Tk 1,333.15 crore compared with that of Tk 1,309.15 crore in the previous trading session.

‘Index highly fluctuated in the first half of the trading session reaching its peak at 5,627 points and lowest at 5,598 points,’ said LankaBangla Securities in its market report.

‘However, from half-day point of the trading session, the index moved at a sharp upward direction until closing at 5,625.33 points,’ it said.

LankaBangla Finance led the turnover chart on the day with its shares worth Tk 56.04 crore changing hands.

BEXIMCO, Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company, Baraka Power, Ratanpur Steel Re-Rolling Mills, Bangladesh Building Systems, Appollo Ispat Complex, Active Fine Chemical Industries, AFC Agro Biotech and IDLC Finance were other turnover leaders.

IPDC Finance gained the most with a 9.31 per cent rise in its share prices, while RN Spinning Mills was the worst loser of the day, shedding 9.42 per cent.
