Raveena Tandon

After a long time away from celluloid, Raveena Tandon is back in a powerful role that’s full of grit, and angst. The actress who was a part of some of B-Town’s most loved comedy marvels, will be seen alongside Divya Jagdale and Anurag Arora in her comeback film, Maatr, reports thequint.com.

The thriller is based on the failure of India’s judicial system in cases like rape. It shows the corrupted bureaucracy and highlights the fight of a mother against all odds as she seeks revenge for her daughter’s death following rape.

Directed by Ashtar Sayed and written by Michael Pellico, the film is all set to release on 21 April. Raveena looks impressive, determined and completely in character as the trailer takes us through the different trials and tribulations that a rape victim’s family undergoes.

Raveena, in a recent interview, also spoken about what punishment a rapist must get.
