Putul Katha wins audience acclaim on premiere show
A still from Putul Katha, which was premiered on Sunday.

Putul Katha, a film featuring struggles of rural women, had its Bangladesh premiere at the Krishibid Institute on Sunday.

Directed by Bangladeshi-born Canadian filmmaker professor Emdad Haque, the film, based on a true story, depicts the tale of Putul (played by Naznin Chumki) who struggles against poverty, hardship and the vested interest people in the society and survives despite overwhelming odds against her.

Depicting Putul’s determination to overcome the hurdles, the film in a very realistic way narrates the story of courage, tension, excitement, sadness of the marginalised people.

Thanks to Emdad’s directorial compositions, the production does not appear as a melodrama as it happens in case of most of films dealing with the similar stories.

‘The storyline of the film is very inspiring. The characters are realistic but there are no exaggerated emotions,’ said Shah Newaz Khan, a viewer of the show.

The film follows Putul, who weaves pati to support her family financially after her husband (played by Joyraj) is crippled in an attack by the local chairman and his goons. After a local journalist Kabir (played by Ahsan Habib) becomes aware of Putul’s struggles he runs a report on his paper on Putul. A Canadian filmmaker Ryan (played by Ryan Klatt) reads the story and comes to visit Bangladesh to make a documentary on Putul.



Speaking at the programme director Emdad Haque, also a teacher of Canadain University of Manitoba said, ‘Putul Katha narrates the true story of thousands of rural women in Bangladesh who are continuously struggling to survive in the society through the character of Putul.’

A full house audience including the state minister for women and children affairs Meher Afroz Chumki enjoyed the premiere show of the film.

‘All the actors have done good job especially Chumki’s performance was praiseworthy,’ Maqsud Rahman, a viewer said.
