Nor’westers to hit country’s north to mid areas
Moderate to severe norwesters accompanied by lightning might strike the country’s northern to mid areas two to three times in the currwent month says a Met Office forecast.

The rest of the country might experience norwesters of light to medium intensity on four or five days, it said.

The Met Office also predicted that a cyclone might originat from one or two depressions to be formed in the bay during the month.

Excessive rainfall has also been predicted for the month.

Extreme heat wave might sweep the northern and the north-western regions once and moderate heat waves might strike the rest of the country once or twice, the Met Office predicted.

Weathermen advised people to stay home or immediately take shelter as soon as they notice that towering clouds, which cause norwesters with lighting, had been formed.

Disaster Management and Relief Ministry officials told New Age that last year alone 300 people were killed by lightning.

Meteorologist Abul Kalam Azad Mallik cautioned farmers not to work on their crop fields as soon as they feel that lightning became imminent.

In the event that time to return home has been lost they should sit down on their toes which would protect them from the lightning.

He strictly asked people to avoid lying down on open areas during lightnings.

Low lying areas and densely populated neighbourhoods are more prone to be struck by deadly lightnings, said weathermen.
