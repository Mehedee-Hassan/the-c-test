All deals signed with India need to be made public: TIB
Transparency International Bangladesh on Sunday said all the agreements, including those signed with India during the prime minister’s ongoing visit, should be placed in Parliament.

‘Even it’s not enough to inform Parliament about the agreements coming from the visit. Parliament should have been informed what agreements were being signed before the visit,’ TIB chairperson Sultana Kamal said while addressing a press conference in the city.

The TIB arranged the conference to disclose the findings of its study titled Parliamentwatch-10th Parliament: 7th to 13th Session at Midas Centre in Dhanmondi. Sultana Kamal said, ‘They did a job but people know nothing about it. Many things are not being made public ...this is definitely unconstitutional step.’

TIB executive director Iftekharuzzaman said 59 international agreements were signed in 2015-’16 fiscal year, but those were not placed and discussed in Parliament.
