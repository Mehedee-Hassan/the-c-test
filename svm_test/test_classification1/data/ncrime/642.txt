Govt urged to refrain from Rampal project
Senior politicians, academics and professionals on Friday urged the government to refrain from the Rampal coal-fired power plant near Sunderbans, as they said the damages of the mangrove forest and the locality would be unrecoverable if the project was implemented.

At a seminar in the capital, they also demanded an open debate and referendum to review the public opinion about the installation of the power plant while the environmentalists had long been insisting that the thermal power plant would damage the biodiversity of the world’s largest mangrove forest.

Shata Nagarik, a civil society body, organised the seminar, while former president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury, Krishak Sramik Janata League president Kader Siddique, Ganashasthaya Kendra founder Zafrullah Chowdhury, former Dhaka University vice-chancellor Emajuddin Ahamed, among others, spoke.

Speaking as the chief guest, Badruddoza Chowdhury said the government was trying to implement the power plant project so speedily that raised suspicion among politicians.

‘There are examples of trails (for some wrongdoings) even after 100 years... Don’t do something for which a trial is needed’, he said.

Kader Siddique said, ‘We want power, but not the project near Sunderbans.’

Zafrullah Chowdhury proposed for referendum and open debate on the issue to review the public view.

Presiding over the meeting, Emajuddin said the Shata Nagarik’s stance against Rampal power plant was not meant for opposing the government.

‘We want the government will give priority to the national interest’, he said.
