South Africans perform first successful penis transplant
The 21-year-old recipient, whose identify is being protected, lost his penis in a botched circumcision, reports BBC.

Doctors in Cape Town said the operation was a success and the patient was happy and healthy.

There have been attempts before, including one in China.

Surgeons at Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital performed a nine-hour operation to attach a donated penis.

The team used some of the techniques that had been developed to perform the first face transplants in order to connect the tiny blood vessels and nerves.

The operation took place on 11 December last year. Three months later doctors say the recovery has been rapid.

Full sensation has not returned and doctors suggest this could take two years.
