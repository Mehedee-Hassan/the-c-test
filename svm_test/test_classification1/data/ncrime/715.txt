Mamata tried to spoil PM’s India tour: Menon
Civil aviation and tourism minister Rashed Khan Menon on Tuesday said West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee tried to spoil prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s India tour with a drop of lime.

He made the remarks while talking to reporters at the local Circuit House in the afternoon after visiting Thakurgaon Airport.

About Mamata’s proposal to share the River Torsa’s water instead of the Teesta, Menon, also president of Workers Party, said, ‘The Torsa can’t be an alternative to the Teesta.’

Mentioning that the Teesta is a trans-boundary river, he said, ‘It’s our right to get due share of the Teesta water. It’s not a matter of one’s mercy.’

Meanwhile, locals blocked the minister’s motorcade at Chourasta in the district town while going to the airport in Pirganj upazila at noon demanding that the airport be reopened soon.

He then got down from the vehicle and assured the agitating people of looking into their demand.
