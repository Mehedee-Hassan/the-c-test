A four-day housing and real estate fair is scheduled to begin at Radisson Blu Bay View Hotel in Chittagong tomorrow to promote sales of affordable flats and plots for the customers.

The Chittagong chapter of Real Estate and Housing Association of Bangladesh (REHAB) is organising the fair for the 10th time in the county’s premier port city.

A total of 72 business firms including real estate companies, financial institutions and building material manufacturing companies from Chittagong and Dhaka will participate in the fair to showcase their offers through 90 stalls, the fair organisers said at a press conference held at Chittagong Club on Monday.

Chairman of REHAB Chittagong regional committee Md Abdul Kauiam Chowdhury said the real estate sector in the country made a comeback as the interest on bank loans came down to single digit recently. Many businessmen are now investing in the sector seeing its bright prospect.

Housing and Public Works Minister Eng Mosharraf Hossain will inaugurate the fair as the chief guest, he said.

Shakil Kamal Chowdhury, director of REHAB & Chairman, REHAB Fair Standing Committee, Mohammad Omar Faruq, director REHAB and Didarul Hoque Chowdhury, director REHAB were, among others, present at the press conference.
