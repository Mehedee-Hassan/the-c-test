BNP claims people rejected defense MoU with India
Bangladesh Nationalist Party senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi on Sunday claimed that people of the country have ‘rejected’ the Memorandum of Understanding on defense cooperation with India signed during prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s on-going visit to New Delhi.

He said the government led by Sheikh Hasina exposed secrecy of Bangladesh’s security to India by signing the defence cooperation deals.

The BNP leader came up with the statements addressing a human-chain organised by Bangladesh National Party in front of National Press Club demanding share of 54 common rivers waters and protesting the ‘anti-state’ agreements signed with India.

About 22 deals and MoUs including in defense, space and energy were signed between Bangladesh and Indian government in presence of prime minister Sheikh Hasina and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi at Hyderabad House in New Delhi on Saturday.

Rizvi said the people of this country would give befitting reply if anyone wants to ‘expand hegemony and wants to break our wall’.

He said people of Bangladesh have no consent to the defense cooperation deal and would not allow implementation of the agreement.

Rizvi said India has compelled to ink the defense memo to control Bangladesh’s security entering inside its security system.

Bangladesh National Party president Syed Ehsanul Huda presided over the event.
