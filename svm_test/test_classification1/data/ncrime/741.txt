HC stays suspension of Dev Studies professor Reazul
The High Court on Sunday stayed for six months the suspension order of Dhaka University professor Md Reazul Haque of development studies department.

The bench of Justice Quazi Reza-Ul Hoque and Justice Mohammad Ullah also issued a rule asking the Dhaka University authorities to explain in four weeks why its syndicate’s decision taken on February 27 suspending Reazul would not be declared illegal.

Petitioner’s lawyer Jyotirmoy Barua argued that the syndicate suspended Reazul through a ‘vague order’ which did not mention reason why he was suspended.

Professor Reazul was not given prior notice to defend himself about his suspension, he added.
