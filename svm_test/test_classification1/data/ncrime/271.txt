The week-long theatre festival by Padatik Natya Sangsad (TSC) ended with staging of two plays at Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy on Tuesday.

Nagorik Natyangan staged the play Kritodaser Hasi at National Theatre Hall while Mahakal Natyasampradaya staged its production Shikhandi Kotha at Experimental Theatre Hall.

Kritodaser Hasi has been adapted from Shawkat Osman’s timeless novel Kritodas-er Hashi (1962). The novel metaphorically depicts common people’s sufferings in the then East Pakistan under military rule. The play has been adapted and directed by Hridi Haque.

Mahakal Natyasampradaya’s play Shikhandi Kotha depicts the joys, woes and frustrations of transgender community.

Padatik organised the festival in memory of Syed Badruddin Hossain, who served as the troupe’s president till his death in 2009. The troupe Padatik has been organising the festival titled ‘Syed Badruddin Hossain Smriti Natya Utsab’ since 2010 marking the birth anniversary of late Hossain.

This year nine local and one Indian troupe participated at the event which featured staging of plays like Prachyanat’s Koinna, BotTola’s Crutcher Colonel, Padatik Natya Sangsad’s Gohon Jatra and Kaalratri, Onnesha Theatre’s Vanu Sundori, Theatre Art Unit’s Amina Sundori, Batighar’s Urnajal, Aranyak Natyadal’s The Jublee Hotel and two plays Parshi Bosot Korey and Antorbihin by visiting Indian troupe Curtail Call.

Padatik honoured eminent thespians SM Solaiman (posthumously) and Lucky Enam on April 7 at part of the event.

‘A large audience came to the festival daily and watched plays,’ Padatik Natya Sangsad’s general secretary Mominul Haque Dipu told New Age.
