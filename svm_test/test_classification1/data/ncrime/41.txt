The UK prime minister’s trade envoy for Bangladesh, Rushanara Ali, arrived in Dhaka on Saturday on a five-day official visit.

‘Besides our historic ties, Bangladesh has exciting opportunities for British companies as its economy is growing impressively,’ Rushanara Ali, a Bangladesh-origin British lawmaker, said in her arrival statement, according to a British High Commission release issued on Sunday.

She said that she would discuss with political and business partners on how trade and investment could be a force for good, creating prosperity and opportunity as well as supporting innovation and creativity.

Marking Rushanara Ali’s visit, British high commissioner Alison Blake said that the visit was a timely opportunity to discuss our commitments to build prosperity for both the countries, supporting Bangladesh’s economic development, and to identify ways to further strengthen commercial and trade ties.

Rushanara Ali, the Labour Party lawmaker for Bethnal Green and Bow constituency, is scheduled to leave Dhaka on December 22.

Over 240 British companies have been operating in sectors including retail, banking, energy, infrastructure, consultancy and education with main centres of operation in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet.
