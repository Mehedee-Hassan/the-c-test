Sunsilk hosts Fashion Fiesta
Sunsilk, a reputed brand and a leading hair care company in Bangladesh, recently organised a gala event at the International Convention City Bashundhara to mark the end of the Sunsilk Fashion Fiesta. Months prior to the event, Sunsilk went on the road to find the best fashion icons in Mymensingh, Dhaka, and Chittagong. After many regional rounds the top ten from each of the regions were chosen. At the event, the thirty fashion icons selected by Sunsilk represented themselves for a chance to be crowned the best of their individual regions.

The event was hosted by Maria Nur who worked up the crowd before the women from Mymensingh took the stage. After Mymensingh's top ten, popular singer Imran entertained the crowd with one of his most popular tunes. It was Chittagong's top ten who took over the ramp after, gracefully showcasing their outfits and hair. Talented singer Topu followed the Chittagong top ten with an impressive number. After his performance, the ramp contest was concluded with Dhaka's top ten. All thirty guests were judged by fashion models Nobel and Azra as well as Bangladesh's renowned hair expert, Adiba Sultana.

Sunsilk's aim was to make sure that these platforms had a positive impact on the lives of the young women. Sunsilk is one of the big players under Unilever Bangladesh and are always eager to improve interactions with their customers. This was a way for Sunsilk to help some of the customers get directly involved. The many segments of the gala event brought to light the number of times Sunsilk has been directly involved with building the confidence of young women. The night ended with an inspiring note that women from every corner of the nation should dream, take that dream forward and write their own story.
