Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy celebrated World Puppet Day by organising programmes featuring discussion, award giving ceremony and puppet shows on Tuesday.

Dhaka-based troupe Jhumur Jhumur Putul Nach and Puppet Theatre Research and Development Centre of Jahangirnagar University presented puppetry at Experimental Theatre Hall of the academy.

Puppeteers depicted cultural heritage of the country, simple village life, a fight scene between a tiger and a crocodile in the Sundarbans, life of fishermen and farmers, and others with puppets at the programme.

Mohammad Ujir Ali, owner of Jhumur Jhumur Putul Naach was honoured at the programme. Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy director general Liaquat Ali Lucky handed over a crest to Ali.

Among others, professor Afsar Ahmed and professor Rashid Harun of Jahangirnagar University’s drama and dramatics department were present on the occasion.

Earlier, in the afternoon, a round table discussion was held at the seminar hall of the academy. Professor Rashid Harun was the main speaker at the session. He pointed out lack of unity, foresight of the troupes and shortage of adequate funds as reasons for the sorry state of traditional puppet arts in the country.
