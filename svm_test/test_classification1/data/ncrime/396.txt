Sajal, popular for his romantic roles in urban settings, will be seen playing the character of a buffalo cart driver in the teleplay titled, ‘Moishal’.

Sajal has talked about the upcoming teleplay and his recent works in an interview with New Age.

‘I have recently completed shooting of the teleplay in which I will be seen as a buffalo cart driver. Playing the character was a challenging task for me as during the shooting I had to do things like driving a buffalo cart, climbing a date tress etc all of which is new to me,’ told Sajal, who also added that the play was shot at a remote village three hours away from Manikganj town.

About the plot of the play Sajal told that Moishal, written by Habib and directed by Azad Kalam, depicts life struggles of buffalo cart drivers who often lead marginalised lives. The teleplay will be aired on a private television channel in coming Eid.

Apart from Sajal the teleplay features Omer Ayaz, Prova and Shilpy Sarkar in different roles.

‘I acted in the play because of its very good storyline. Besides, Moishal is not like typical productions of these days. It is a good quality teleplay,’ said Sajal, who also informed that generally he usually does not do teleplays in rural settings.

‘Teleplays depicting village life are more difficult to make because of the set requirements which involves rural settings, dialects and rural life. Therefore, I do not do such teleplays if the director isn’t very good,’ said Sajal.

Speaking about his recent work Sajal said that recently he has acted in teleplays directed by Mahmud Didar and Ferdous Hasan Rana.
