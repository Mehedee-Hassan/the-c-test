Thirty-seven people were killed when a fire swept through an aged psychiatric hospital in northwest Russia overnight Thursday, the latest tragedy to hit the country's mental health institutions.

The pre-dawn fire was apparently started by a patient who was either smoking or deliberately set fire to his bed at the hospital in the village of Luka, 220 kilometres southeast of Saint Petersburg, officials said.

The single-storey wood-and-concrete building housed around 60 male patients including some who had amputated legs or were bedbound, and the institution had been previously warned by the authorities to improve its fire safety.

Novgorod region governor Sergei Mitin told AFP at the scene that 23 people had been rescued from the fire.

Local authorities said the hospital housed patients with grave psychological disorders, making evacuation even more complicated.

Investigators said they had opened a criminal probe into suspected negligence causing death.

Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev also instructed the labour and social development minister Maxim Topilin to travel to the village.
