Mustafiz leaves for IPL
Bangladesh paceman Mustafizur Rahman left for India on Tuesday to join Sunrisers’ Hyderabad for his second season in the Indian Premier League.

Mustafiz, who played a pivotal role to help Hyderabad winning their maiden IPL title in the last season, was supposed to join the side in Mumbai today.

Defending champions will face Mumbai Indians today and there is a high probability that the Bangladeshi will play the match.

Mustafiz looked confident at the academy building of the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium before leaving for the airport on Tuesday.

‘I want to do even better this time round, please pray for me,’ Mustafiz told reporters.

Mustafiz became a revelation in the last IPL as he became an instant star from a very little known bowler and he reckoned with his familiar atmosphere it would be easier for him in the current season.

‘Everything was unfamiliar for me last time. This time I know the players, dressing room, venues. It will be easier this time for me to play in IPL. I want to produce my best performance if I am selected.’

Mustafiz will miss the national team’s camp that will be held in England at early of the next month for his IPL commitment but he will join Tigers before the Tri-series in Ireland that will start from May 12.

‘I have consulted with the board. I will go to Ireland from India,’ said the bowler.
