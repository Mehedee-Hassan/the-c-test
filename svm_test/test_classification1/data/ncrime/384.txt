I’m happy where I am today
Jannatul Ferdous Peya, the first ever Bangladeshi model to be featured on the cover of Vogue India, became the first Bangladeshi fashion personality to participate at the prestigious New York Fashion Week 2017.

NYFW is the major international fashion event featuring global fashion icons, brands, international models, runway shows and more.

Held in February and September of each year, the fashion week displays international fashion collections to buyers, the press and the general public. This year the event was held from February 9 - 16.

‘The week is a global fashion platform. I was really honoured to attend the occasion. I went there as the brand ambassador of Tresemme,’ Peya said.

‘During my three day visit, I had the oppourtunity to witness runway shows, presentations and beyond. I must add that the quality of the shows there is something which we all should aspire to reach,’ said Peya.

Peya started modeling after she became Miss Bangladesh in 2007. She made her acting debut in the telefilm titled ‘To Be or Not to Be’ by Partho Sarkar and made her silver screen debut as an actress through Redwan Rony's film Chorabali in 2012. For acting in the film she received Meril Prothom Alo Award in critics’ choice category. Later two more films featuring Peya titled ‘The Story of Samara’ and ‘Gangster Returns’ were released.

Currently Peya is busy with photo shoots and her work. She studied at the department of law.

‘I was never desperate to become famous. I am happy where I am today,’ Peya told New Age.
