Robi fined Tk 4.1 lakh for deceiving clients
The Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection on Monday fined mobile operator Robi Tk 4.1 lakh for three incidents of deceiving clients for internet packages.

Officials of DNRC said Robi was fined Tk 2.5 lakh, Tk 1.5 lakh and Tk 10,000 respectively for three incidents based on complaints filed by subscribers.

Among them, one of the subscribers Sohag lodged a complaint against the operator alleging that it gave 1 GB of data taking Tk 98 for a advertised-package of 1.5GB for Tk 98.

Shaheen Ara Momtaz, a deputy director of the DNCRP, imposed the fines on Robi after conducting hearings on the allegations of false advertisement and breaching promise.

When asked, Robi’s vice-president Ekram Kabir told New Age, ‘We will extend all kind of cooperation.’

He declined to comment further.

Robi was earlier fined Tk 5,000 in February this year after a customer complained about the semantics of the operator’s internet package offer.
