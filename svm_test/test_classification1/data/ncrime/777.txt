No BB nod needed for foreign cos to issue taka bond
Bangladesh Bank on Wednesday said foreign companies operating in Bangladesh would be allowed to collect long-term fund from local banks, corporate groups, non-bank financial institutions and individuals by issuing taka bond without taking prior approval from the central bank.

The foreign companies were earlier allowed to collect the long-term fund taking prior approval of the central bank in line with Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Transactions-2009.

The BB issued a circular to authorised dealer branches of all banks saying that the foreign companies would have to take permission from Bangladesh Securities and Exchange commission before issuing the taka bond.

A BB official told New Age on Wednesday, that the central bank had taken the initiative to liberalise the country’s foreign exchange regime so that the foreign investors would encourage investing in the country.
