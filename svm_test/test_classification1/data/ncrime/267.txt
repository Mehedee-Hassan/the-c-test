Shakib won’t hold press conference Tuesday
The film star, Shakib Khan, brushed off any chance of holding press conference on Tuesday to explain his stand over his co-actress Apu Bishwash’s claim that they got married in 2008 and have a son.

‘I did not call for any press conference in this regard and don’t know how this fake information comes from. This might be a part of conspiracy against me’ he said New Age over cell phone.

Popular Dhallywood actress Opu Biswas, after a year of complete seclusion, made her first public appearance on a TV channel on Monday and claimed that she converted to Islam after marrying Dhallywood superstar Shakib Khan in 2008 and bore him a son in September.

With her six-month child Abraham Khan Joy, Opu came to News 24 office at Bashundhara Residential Area.

She, however, did not mention why the couple kept their marriage secret but said that she was shocked as Shakib started neglecting her since the beginning of her life in seclusion in March 2016, which she claimed she did being instructed by Shakib.
