The country’s point-to-point inflation hit a 51-month low to 5.03 per cent in December in the current fiscal year 2016-17.

Officials concerned attributed the lower inflation to decreased commodity prices in the domestic and international market, political stability and stable economic activities.

In November, the overall inflation rate was 5.38 per cent.

According to the latest data of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, the country witnessed the previous lowest inflation rate at 4.96 per cent in September 2012.

Planning minister AHM Mustafa Kamal, however, on Tuesday claimed that the point-to-point inflation hit a 53-month low in December.

According to the BBS, both food and non-food inflation at national, urban and rural level also declined last month.

Kamal released the consumer price index, or CPI, known as inflation data, at a post-ECNEC press briefing held at NEC conference room at Agargaon in the capital Dhaka.

He said that inflation dropped to the lowest level in 53 months in December due to practical policy measures taken by the government.

The BBS started calculating inflation rate considering 2005-2006 as the base year in July 2012 when the inflation rate was calculated at 5.21 per cent for the month compared with that of 8.03-per cent inflation as per the previous 1995-96 base-year.

According to the BBS data, food inflation dropped to 5.38 per cent in December from that of 5.41 per cent in November while non-food inflation declined to 4.49 per cent in the month (December) from 5.33 per cent in the previous month.

The point-to-point inflation in urban and rural areas stood at 6.07 per cent and 4.46 per cent respectively in December which was 6.56 per cent and 4.75 per cent respectively in the previous month.

Both food and non-food inflation in both urban and rural areas also came down in December, the data showed.

At the briefing, Kamal also released the progress report of the implementation of the annual development programme in the first half of the current fiscal year.

He said that 26.7 per cent of the total allocation under the ADP was implemented in July-December period of the current fiscal year.

In the same period of the last fiscal year, the government ministries and divisions could implement 24 per cent of the ADP for that year, Kamal said.

ADP implementing agencies could spend Tk 33,000 crore in the first six months of the current fiscal year against Tk 23,000 crore spent in the same months of the last fiscal year, he said.

The minister hoped that the rate of ADP implementation would increase in the months to come.
