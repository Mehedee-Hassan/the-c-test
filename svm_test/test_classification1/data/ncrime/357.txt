Sammilito Sangskritik Jote’s two-week cultural programme marking International Mother Language Day is underway at the Central Shaheed Minar.

Different cultural organisations and solo artistes are presenting music, recitation, dance and street drama every evening at the venue since the beginning of the programme on February 8.

On Wednesday, Bangla Natya Dal staged street drama Tui Chor, written by Nasir Ahmed and directed by Mohammad Shahiduzzaman.

The play satirisies evil politicians of the country, who misuse their powers for only personal interest but not for the people.

Recitation organisation Muktabak in chorus presented Hasan Hafizur Rahman’s poem Ek Saar Thoka Thoka Jalanto Naam.

Tamanna Tithi recited Imran Nur’s poem Galpo Shonai Galpo Shono.

Banhishikha artistes entertained the audience presenting traditional song Sona Sona Sona Loke Bole Sona.

Artistes of Ujan rendered patriotic songs, including Amra Banlai Gaan Gai and Amar Desher Moto Emon Desh Ki Kothao Achhe.

Artistes of music troupe Anandan presented popular people’s song Rakto Shimul Tapta Polash. Fayzul Bari rendered Amar Bangla Mayer.

People from different strata of life enjoyed the show. ‘The show featured different types of performances by noted artistes and groups,’ said Rafayet Karim, a university student.

SSJ’s programme at the Shaheed Minar will continue till today. From tomorrow, the organisation will hold the similar cultural programme at Rabindrasarobar in Dhanmondi and it will continue till February 21.

SSJ, the platform of cultural organbisations working in the country, has been paying tribute to the language movement heroes by organising programmes at these two venues since 1987.
