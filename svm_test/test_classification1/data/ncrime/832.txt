Khaled Khan's 60th birth anniversary
Marking the 60th birth anniversary (February 9) of noted actor Khaled Khan, popularly known as Juboraj to his countless fans and colleagues, a memorial programme will be held at the National Theatre Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy at 5:30pm today.

The programme will feature performance of songs, dance, drama, documentary and discussion. Juboraj Sangho has organised the programme to pay tribute to the evergreen actor who passed away in 2013.

A dominating performer, Khaled enthralled his audience on stage and on-screen for three decades. The multi-talented personality started his career as a member of Nagarik Natya Sampraday in 1975. Since then, he appeared in more than 30 plays. Not just as an actor, Khaled also shone as a theatre director and one of the finest elocutionists in Bangladesh.
