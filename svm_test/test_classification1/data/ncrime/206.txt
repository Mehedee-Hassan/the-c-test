Shimul depicts mysticism in paintings
Visitors look at displayed paintings at AFD.

Artist AZ Shimul has depicted portraits of Bangladeshi bauls and ritualistic Sufi dance of the Turkish Sufis in his debut solo underway at La Galerie, Alliance Française de Dhaka.

The show titled ‘Emotion of Sufi Music’ displays 19 abstract paintings featuring motifs and instruments of the mystic bauls, a portrait of Fakir Lalon Shah and eight figurative paintings of Turkey-based Sufis’ whirling-dance in different mediums including oil, acrylic and mixed media.

Shimul, who grew up in a Sufi family, has been influenced by the thoughts and philosophy of Sufism from an early age. Using bright colours and bold brush strokes the artist has drawn his memories, experiences and beliefs on his canvasses. He has painted the mystic bards of the country and their portraits.

Though, Shimul has seen Sufis’ whirling-dance only in videos and photos and not physically, he has painted the dance because he thinks that the dance genre is a very rich tradition of Sufism.

In his abstract work displayed at the show Shimul has depicted a baul holding a dotaara. The face of the bual can hardly be seen in the work. The dotaara can be recognised in the painting, which is dominated by bright blue colour.

Shimul has also paid tribute to legendary folk bard Fakir Lalon Shah through a displayed portrait of Lalon as he considers himself a devotee of Fakir Lalon Shah and often visits the Shrine of Lalon in Kushtia. The painting, which is dominated by red-organce colour, shows side-view of Lalon sitting on a chair.

The exhibition will remain open for all from 3pm to 8pm every day except Sundays till March 31.
