Symphony of Needle-Work: The intricate beauty of needle craft.
Embroidering, spangling with saris, weaving a yarn of wool into a warm sweater for the winter and all kinds of needle work have a long history with rural Bengal. From colourful flowers, to modern geometric designs, needle craft in Bangladesh is one with a long history that weaves through heart of Bengal.

To celebrate this intricate art form, one of the country's leading fashion houses, Bibiana arranged an exhibition at the city's EMK center in MIDAS tower showcasing Saris, scarves, Kameezes, bags and ornaments all featuring striking works of needle craft.

Graced by Marcia Bernicat, US Ambassador to Bangladesh and Akku Chowdhury, the exhibition named Symphony of Needle-Work, 2015 opened its doors on June 16 and will continue till June 25.

With colourful Sari's exhibiting the baroque designs of the needlework, the exhibition reflects on Bibiana's theme as well.

In the tide of time, as this art form stands the risk of being lost, Bibiana's Lipi Khandaker has taken a brave attempt at reviving this. Jessore, Kushtia, Rajbaari, the birthplace of this thousand year old art form today stands at a risk of being lost forever and to showcase it in an exhibition will give the beautiful and enchanting needlework a chance to revive itself.
