Ministers to get new apartments at Bailey Road
A six-storey apartment building is being constructed involving Tk 47.75 crore for ministers in the city’s Bailey Road area.



Housing and public works minister Mosharraf Hossain inaugurated the construction work on ‘Ministers’ Apartment’ on Wednesday.



Housing secretary Md Shaheed Ullah Khandaker, public works department chief engineer Md Hafizur Rahman were, among others, present on the occasion.



Ten ministers will be able to reside in 10 furnished apartments — 2,248 square feet each having four bed rooms, drawing, dining rooms and car parking space. Besides, a 1,400-sqft office building will be constructed there, said a PID handout.



It will take nearly two years to complete the works on the project.



While inaugurating the construction work, Mosharraf Hossain said only eight per cent of around 1.5 lakh government officials have housing facility at present. This facility will be raised to 40 per cent by 2018, he said.



More housing projects are being taken for government officials, he said.
