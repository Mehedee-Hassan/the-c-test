Arafat Sunny has been going through some torrid time on and off the field but that could not stop the left-arm spinner to start his Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League campaign with a five-for to help his side win on Wednesday.

Sunny was banned for illegal bowling action during the ICC World Twenty20 last year and during his struggle to return to the top-flight with a remodeled action he was accused of abusing a woman online and was held in police custody early in the year.

But he could put aside all those agonies as his 5-33 demolished Partex Sporting Club and helped his side, Prime Dolehswar, last year’s runners-up team, winning the match by 78 runs.

Dolehswar made 287-9 thanks to half centuries of Abdul Mazid and Marshall Ayub before Sunny made the score too much for Partex, who were finally restricted to 209-9 at BKSP. Sunny was the wrecker-in-chief but medium pacer Farhad Reza provided the early blow by removing both Partex openers Tarik Ahmed ( seven) and Irfan Sukkur (19) in the same score at eighth over to reduce them to 26-2.

Sunny removed one-down Shahnur Rahman for a duck to make the score 32-3 but Yash Pal Singh and Sazzadul Haque tried to resurrect the innings.

Sunny got rid of Sazzadul for 43 to break the 91-run stand in 36th over before picking up Zakaria Masud to make the score 155-5 in 40th over.

In his next over Sunny made Yash, who made 74 off 96 balls, a catch of Shahriar Nafees to finish any hope Partex had, to pull off a heist.

Earlier in the day, Imtiaz Hossain (38) and Mazid, who made highest 77, gave Doleshwar a solid start with an 84-run opening stand.

One-down Nafees was dismissed for a duck and Punit Singh was out for 29 but Marshal made 63 and with the help of some contributions of the late-order put a big score on the board.
