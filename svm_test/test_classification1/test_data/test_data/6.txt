Meat traders likely to go on strike in Ramadan
Meat traders in Dhaka will go on an indefinite strike from 26 May, the first day of Ramadan, protesting the ‘excessive tax collection’ by lessees of Dhaka’s Gabtali cattle market.



The Dhaka Metropolitan Meat Traders’ Association will announce a new protest programme from where the strike announcement may come tomorrow (Sunday), said its secretary general Rabiul Alam.



Rabiul Alam added that they will call an indefinite strike to press home their several demands including constructing a permanent cattle market in Dhaka South City Corporation, and building a number of quality slaughterhouses.



He added that they will start the strike from the first day of Ramadan if the demands are not met within 15 days.



Meat traders alleged that meat prices have been on the rise, as the lessees force them to collect an extra Tk 5000 for every animal.



Earlier, the traders called a six-day countrywide strike from 13 to 18 February to press home their four-point demand.
