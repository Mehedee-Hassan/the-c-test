Bangladeshi girl dies in California plane crash
A Bangladeshi girl has died in a training plane crash near Ramona in Southern California.

The victim was identified as Sayra Nur Lamisa, 20, daughter of Captain Zakir Hosen of Bangladesh Biman, reports Bangla daily Prothom Alo.

Cal Fire Capt Issac Sanchez told the San Diego Union Tribune that they received a report of the crash Sunday afternoon.

Authorities Monday recovered the body from the crash site on a mountainside in a remote back- country area north of Ramona, reports the Ramona Patch.

A 28-year-old man and a 25-year-old man survived the crash. They have been transported to Palomar Hospital with minor injuries. They were flying from the American Aviation Academy out of Gillespie Field, Cal Fire says. It was an instructor-student flight, reports NBC 7.

"The fact that we had two survivors absolutely is fortunate for them, but, again, we are dealing with a fatality and there's going to be a family out there that's going to be grieving," Isaac tells NBC 7.

A witness, who saw the plane go down, called 911 immediately but it took rescuers in a helicopter about an hour to find the wreckage, according to the Daily Mail.
