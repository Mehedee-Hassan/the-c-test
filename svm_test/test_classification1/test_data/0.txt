‘Eagle Hunt’ : Sporadic gunshots heard as SWAT resumes operation
The Special Weapons and Tactics resumed its operation at Shibnagar Trimohoni ‘extremist den’ under Shibganj upazila in Chapainawabganj on Thursday morning.

TM Mojahidul Islam, superintendent of Chapainawabganj police, said the team started its operation, codenamed ‘Eagle Hunt’, around 9:15am.

Sounds of sporadic gunshots were heard from the den in the morning.

The operation was postponed for technical reasons on Wednesday night.

A SWAT team of the Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime unit under Dhaka Metropolitan Police started the operation around 6:45pm on Wednesday.

The police superintendent said four to five big explosions took place at the house as the ‘extremists threw’ four grenades at the law enforcers after the operation had begun on Wednesday.

The CTTC suspects that there are three to four extremists, including one Abu, in the house.

Tipped-off, police encircled the suspected extremist hideout around 5:30am, said officer-in-charge of Shibganj police station Habibul Islam.

‘The extremists fired several gunshots from the house towards the law enforcers in the morning,’ the police officer-in-charge said. Later, a CTTC team joined the police, he said.

Locals claimed Abu along with his family rented the house two and half months ago introducing him as a spice vendor.
