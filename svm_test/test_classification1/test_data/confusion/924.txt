Publishers alert, not scared
The pain, angst and horror are still fresh. But, Razia Rahman Jolly, wife of slain publisher Faisal Arefin Dipan, has decided to participate in the upcoming book fair to uphold Dipan’s ideals.

The brutal murder of Jagriti publisher Faisal Arefin Dipan, attack on Shuddhashwar publisher Ahmed Rashid Tutul, and murder of author Avijit Roy at TSC during the last Ekushey Book Fair, have made the publishers panicked.

However, they believe despite all of those untoward incidents, there will be high turnout this year as the political situation is not as volatile as it was during the last two years.

‘Of course, the fear is there. The sole reason of participating in this book fair is to keep Dipan’s ideals alive. I think Jagriti’s participation in the book fair itself is a big success after all the unfathomable anguish I have been through following Dipan’s murder. Nothing could make up the void created after his death but we are participating in the fair to uphold his beliefs,” said Razia.

“It took us a long while to recover from the psychological trauma we have undergone since Dipan was murdered. Still, somewhere along the way, I felt that I have to keep Jagriti publication going as it was Dipan’s dream,” said Razia.

This year the number of participating organizations has shot up as compared to last year.

Bangla Academy sources have said that apart from Bangla Academy, a total of 401 organisations will participate in the book fair while the number was 328 in 2015.

Robin Ahsan of Srabon Prokashan said, “We have had such repeated threats before. The Ramna Batamul bombing in 2001 could not stop the commoners from visiting Ramna the year after the horrific attack. It clearly says the people here in Bangladesh have a history of protesting extremism.”

Robin also fears that the publishers might refrain from publishing books on free-thinking this year.

Aninda Rahman, executive director of BPL, said their publication house is not carrying out any self-censorship.

‘We are alert, but not scared. If we have to back out for the threats of being attacked, we cannot run our publication business here in this country,” said Aninda.

President of Bangladesh Publishers and Booksellers Association (BAPUS), Alamgir Shikder Loton, said, “I don’t think there would be a low turnout this time. Ekushey Book Fair was inflicted with political turmoil of the city the last two years. The political situation is stable as compared to last two years, so we hope to sell more books in this Book Fair.”

Mahrukh Mohiuddin, director of marketing and business development at UPL (The University Press Limited) believes the publishers should be more sensible about the language of the books they publish.

“As publishers we have certain liabilities. We have to be more strategic and careful while publishing books,” she said.

“Security concerns are an issue not just in Bangladesh. The security situation is very volatile the whole world over. We do not feel there’s any extra risk for the upcoming book fair,” she added.

Shova Prokash publisher Mizan said publishing house is not just a business for him. He believes the books they offer work as a catalyst to shape the mind of the young generation.

“Limiting ourselves to publishing certain kinds of books will shrink the space for freedom of expression. It does not matter if we are at stake or not, we will not back out,” said Mizan.

Talking to Prothom Alo regarding the tight security measures of the upcoming book fair, Dr Jalal Ahmed, the fair committee member secretary, said the security measures have been beefed up manifold to avoid any untoward incident this year.

‘Bangla Academy does not have a security force of its own. The best we could do is to share our recommendations with the concerned authorities. We have an inter-ministry meeting particularly on security issues for the first time this year,” said Jalal Ahmed.

He told Prothom Alo about 250 to 300 close circuit cameras will be installed this time while last year there were only 60.

The month-long book fair is scheduled to begin on 1 February.

The gates will open for the visitors at 3:00 pm and close at 8:00 pm.

On Friday and Saturday, the gate will open at 11:00 am.
