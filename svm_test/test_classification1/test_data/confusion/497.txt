‘6,000 BNP workers arrested since polls schedule’
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) acting secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Friday urged voters to guard every polling station in 30-December ballots to resist vote fraud, reports UNB news agency.

“The country is now under one-party rule. So, people should stay alert and guard the polling stations so that the ruling party can’t snatch voter’s verdict,” the BNP leader made the call while addressing voters in Thakurgaon municipality.

He alleged that around six thousand BNP leaders and activists have been arrested since the announcement of the election schedule.

Fakhrul sought votes in favour of BNP candidates and said their party has participated in the election as part of its movement for restoration of democracy.

Stating that the country is going through a hard time, he said the current government is trying to annihilate its opponents by establishing one-party rule.

Flanked by local BNP leaders, Mirza Fakhrul started election campaign from Satyapriya Bridge in Thakurgaon municipality seeking votes in favour of his younger brother and BNP mayoral contestant Mirza Foysal Amin.

Later in the day, he also addressed the voters at Ghoshpara, Fakirpara and Goalpara.
