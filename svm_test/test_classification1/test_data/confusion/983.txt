"I didn't say to kill Khaleda"
Information minister Hasanul Haque Inu said he had not meant any life threat to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia by his comment which many BNP leaders protested saying the minister's the remark was an indirect threat to the former premier.

Rejecting the BNP leaders’ allegation information minister on Wednesday claimed that he had actually said to remove Khaleda Zia from politics instead of removing her from earth.

“The allegation of BNP leaders that I’ve threatened to kill Khaleda Zia is not true. I didn’t say in my speech to kill her. I’d said people will remove the BNP chief if she doesn’t sever her ties with Hefajat, Jamaat and militancy, and shun destructive politics,” he said.

Talking to reporters at his secretariat office, Inu came up with the explanation of his remarks about Khaleda Zia he had made on Friday at a programme arranged by the members of Hindu community at Shamibagh in Dhaka.

On Monday, BNP leader Rizvi Ahmed at a press briefing alleged that the minister while addressing the programme of the Hindu Community threatened to remove Khaleda Zia from earth.
