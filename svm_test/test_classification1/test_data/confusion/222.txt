SC upholds Fakhrul’s bail
The Supreme Court on Monday upheld BNP acting secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir’s bail decision of High Court for six weeks.

The SC upheld the bail on medical ground in three vandalism and arson cases and said he can also go abroad if needed for better treatment during the bail period.

A four-member bench of the Appellate Division led by Chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha passed the order.

The order cleared way to Fakhrul’s release from jail.

The court came up with the order after acting attorney general Murad Reza submitted a report on the health condition of the BNP leader from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU).

The report said that Fakhrul is suffering from vascular disease and needs better treatment.

Lawyer Khandaker Mahbub Hossain, Moudud Ahmed and M Mahbubuddin Khokon stood for Mirza Fakhrul.

Khandaker Mahbub Hossain said they will appeal to extend the bail if needed.
