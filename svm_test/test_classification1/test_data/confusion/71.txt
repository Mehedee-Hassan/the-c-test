Domestic gas crisis to continue: Nasrul
State minister for power energy and mineral resources said there will be no let up in domestic gas crisis soon, and urged the domestic gas users to opt for LPG (liquefied petroleum gas).



The minister, Nasrul Hamid, was talking to journalists after a seminar, titled ‘Renewable Energy for Sustainable Development: Bangladesh Context’, at the Dhaka University on Wednesday.



“Our priority is to supply adequate gas to industrial areas. We are approaching that direction. We want industrial growth through ensuring availability of gas in the sector,” Nasrul said.



Asked whether government is giving preference to the industries than the household use of gas, Nasrul said, “This is not that what we are saying. But changes are coming. Try to get used to with the changes. Government is trying to make LPG cost effective for all, and also trying to keep the price under control. We want 70 per cent of the domestic piped gas users should shift to LPG in the next three years.”

“The gas pressure is low now. But we’ll provide the gas necessary for you. This might take four-five months,” said the state minister to the industry owners.

Answering to a question whether the domestic gas crisis is made due to giving importance to the industry sector, Nasrul Hamid said it is not fair judging whole Bangladesh with only one or two cities. Most of the people of the country are using LPG, he observed. Talking about the ongoing gas crisis, minister said there is a problem in the pipeline, and It will take three-four days to get fixed.

The seminar was presided over by Dhaka University vice chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddiqui. State minister Nasrul Hamid inaugurated a three-day renewable energy exhibition after seminar.
