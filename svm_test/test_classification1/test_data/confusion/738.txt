Do not write reports that can harm country: Home minister
Home minister Asaduzzaman Khan on Monday urged the journalists to refrain from writing reports that harm the country's interest.



“Don’t publish any report which can damage country’s image. It is my earnest request, and I submit it to your conscience,” said Asaduzzaman Khan while addressing the biannual general meeting of Greater Dhaka Journalist Forum at the National Press Club.



Home minister also said those who want to thwart the war crime trials are carrying out subversive activities in the country.

Asaduzzaman said, “Those who had been involved in the assassination of Bangabandhu, and the 21 August grenade attack on prime minister Sheikh Hasina, are entwined with the same thread.”



Former Dhaka bureau chief of Associated Press (AP) Farid Hossain chaired the programme where Advocate Sanjida Khanam MP also spoke.
