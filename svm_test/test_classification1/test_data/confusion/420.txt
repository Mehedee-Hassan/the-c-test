Joy lashes out at Imran
Prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s son and her ICT adviser Sajeeb Wazed Joy on Sunday blasted Shahbagh’s Ganajagaran Mancha spokesperson Imran H Sarker for denouncing the arrest of senior journalist Shafiq Rehman.





In a Facebook status posted at 7:45pm local time, Joy insisted that the US Department of Justice “discovered Shafik Rehman’s direct involvement in the plot to kidnap and kill" him.

“They provided this evidence to our government. He was arrested based on this evidence. I cannot disclose more, but the evidence is direct and irrefutable,” claimed Sajeeb, also a US citizen.

Expressing his surprise at Imran Sarker’s demand for the release of Shafik Rehman, he said, “I expected the BNP to try to lie about this. However, I am surprised at Imran Sarkar. Perhaps he has finally exposed his true face. It looks like he has become like most of our civil society, another opportunist and a liar."

"Maybe the BNP paid him off. Who knows. Either way, I have lost all respect for him. He needs to retract his statement and apologize to our government,” Joy added.

He also urged all of his friends and fans who follow Imran H Sarker to unfollow and unfriend him on Facebook.

“He is speaking on behalf of a criminal who tried to kill me,” read Joy's status.

In a Facebook status on Saturday, Imran H Sarker condemned the arrest and remand of noted journalist Shafik Rehman, also in view of his age.

Sarker then said it was disappointing that a veteran journalist was arrested on imaginary charges while murderers of bloggers, publisher, foreigners, and people of different religious views got scot free.

“I want an end to this dirty political tactics of suppressing dissent.” On a Facebook post on Saturday, Imran wrote.
