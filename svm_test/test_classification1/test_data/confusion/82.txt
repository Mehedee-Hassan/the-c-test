'Suspending GSP jeopardises workforce'




Bangladesh envoy to Washington Akramul Qader said Bangladesh’s RMG sector is still recovering from the shocks caused by the Rana Plaza building collapse and the fire in the Tazreen factory. “But the US government’s response of suspending GSP for Bangladesh has not helped address the underlying issues beneath the deadly incidents rather put the workforce into jeopardy.”

Akramul Qader made the comment while addressing Rumi Forum in Washington DC on Thursday, said a foreign ministry media release on Friday.

Replying to a question on the labour safety and rights, the Ambassador focused on the steps taken by the government on the labour safety and labour rights in Bangladesh.

While the US Congress consistently advocates for improved labour conditions in Bangladesh, it always shies away from offering any tariff concession to Bangladesh apparels, said the Bangladesh envoy to Washington.

“There’s no doubt that it would have given much needed financial rooms for the industries to improve workers’ safety and rights in Bangladesh if the US congress could have offered duty-free access or alternative tariff concessions,” said Akramul Qader.

In 2013, Bangladesh exported US $ 4.90 billion of RMG to the US market and paid tariffs of almost $ 820 million, he said adding that Bangladeshi garments enter the US market after paying an exceptionally high tariff ranging from 8 to 32%.

Alyssa Ayres, senior fellow for India, Pakistan, and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and former deputy assistant secretary of state moderated the discussion for South and Central Asian Bureau.

The envoy said the US is a major destination for products made in Bangladesh, receiving nearly a fourth of Bangladesh’s total exports. Apart from providing low-cost fashions and apparel solutions to the US consumers, Bangladesh’s RMG is also a source of huge revenue for the US government.

The envoy also spoke on the socioeconomic development, labour safety, labour rights, 10th parliamentary elections, International Crimes Tribunal and Bangladesh-US trade and economic relations.

Responding to a question, he said the present government is steadfast to preserve the human rights and freedom of media in the country.

In a question on the 10th parliamentary elections, he said the 10th national election was held under an unprecedented commitment of the government to uphold the constitutional obligation and strengthen the democratic process in the country.

The Bangladesh ambassador commended Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s decision to cease violence and participate in the subsequent upazilla elections, which are proofs the credibility of the existing election mechanism in the country.

Encouraged by a resilient economy, he said, Bangladesh could choose to take courageous decisions like building Padma multipurpose bridge with only domestic finance.

He also said Bangladesh’s economic relations with foreign countries have been changed from predominantly aid-recipient to a trade one.
