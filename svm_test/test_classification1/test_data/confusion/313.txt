Terrorism key impediment to global peace: PM
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Friday reiterated her government's firm stance on maintaining "zero-tolerance" policy to all forms of terrorism, violent extremism and radicalisation, saying such problems remain major impediments to global peace and growth.

Referring to the spread of terrorism and violent ideologies in many parts of the world, Sheikh Hasina categorically said her government would continue denouncing terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.

The Prime Minister said this while making a statement at the intervention of the Retreat Session titled "Enhancing Dialogue and Cooperation between Asia and Europe and Future Direction" on the concluding day of the 10th ASEM Summit at Milano Congressi in Italy today.

Sheikh Hasina highlighted the brutality of terrorist and extremist groups in Bangladesh in the last year for destroying the progressive and secular fabric of the nation.

The Prime Minister reaffirmed her government's firm resolve not to allow any terrorist individual or group to use Bangladesh's land against any state.

On global aspects, she called upon the United Nations to formulate a strategy for fighting terrorism and violent extremism.

Talking about the Israeli atrocities on the Palestinian people in Gaza recently, the Bangladesh premier once again denounced Israeli massacre, saying such killings are not acceptable.

Sheikh Hasina reaffirmed her commitment to low-carbon and climate-resilient development path and urged the large carbon-emitting countries to reciprocate by robust voluntary pledges from nations like Bangladesh to face the adverse impact of climate change.

In this connection, she reassured that Bangladesh would never exceed the average per capita carbon emissions of the developing world.

Sheikh Hasina also expressed Dhaka's concern over the huge gap between the commitments of the developed world and their initiatives to fulfil the pledges, saying the global action of sharing the burden is absent.
