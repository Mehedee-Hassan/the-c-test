‘AL needs no hybrid leaders’
Ruling Awami League presidium member and road transport and bridges minister Obaidul Quader on Thursday said the ruling party requires no “hybrid leaders” to join the AL.

Justifying his stance, the minister said, “They [hybrid leaders] would join the AL and left the party after committing crimes.”

Addressing a view-exchange meeting with reporters at Rajshahi Circuit House in the evening, the AL leader said the party is enquiring about the “hybrid leaders” who are joining the ruling party across the country.”

A number of BNP and Jamaat leaders and activists including accused in murder cases recently joined the AL in different parts of the country. This is for the first time any AL presidium member and also a minister spoke about the matter publicly.

Obadul Quader also said, “They might be accepted primarily, but the final approval will have to be taken from Sheikh Hasina from Dhaka.”

He said he believes Sheikh Hasina would not allow them to join the party.

Dwelling on the debate between the AL and JSD leaders over the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Obaidul Quader said, “Our leader Sheikh Hasina is well aware of the matter. The matter will be discussed in the party forum.
