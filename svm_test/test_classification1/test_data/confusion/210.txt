Gas price hiked only for reckless looting: BNP
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has termed the gas tariff hike illogical and anti-people, calling on the government to overturn its decision.

Shortly after the announcement of raising prices of gas for all kinds of use by an average of 22.7 per cent, the BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir convened an impromptu press conference at the party chairperson’s Gulshan office to lodge its protest.

The party, however, announced no street agitation programmes against the government decision.

“Keeping the people hostage, the government has decided to raise the gas prices only for reckless looting. The people will not accept the decision of the price hike,” Fakhrul told the media briefing.
