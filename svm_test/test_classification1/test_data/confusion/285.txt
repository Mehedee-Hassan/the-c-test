Call for concerted efforts to curb terrorism
Bangladesh is in great trouble because of the rise of militancy under the aegis of politics, believe members of Sammilita Nagarik Samaj, a civil society body.

They urged everyone to be united against violence, militancy and terrorism to build a democratic and secular Bangladesh.

They made the call at the national convention of Sammilita Nagarik Samaj held at the Engineers' Institute auditorium in the city on Satureday.

Noted economist and Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation chairman Qazi Kholiquzzaman placed a nine-point demand before the government at the convention. The demands include taking stern action against militancy and terrorism, compensating the families of the people killed in the turmoil, speedy trial of war criminals and terminating the funding sources of the militants and terrorist groups.

Kholiquzzaman said, "The blockade has stepped into day 83. Farmers, labours, different professionals -- people from all walks of life have been suffering for this ongoing political unrest."

The Sammilita Nagarik Samaj is an open platform for mass people that will work for the country with the spirit of the liberation war, he added.

He urged the leaders of different political parties to uphold the spirit of the liberation war and sit for a dialogue.

"The countrymen have fallen into the abyss of this political crisis. The students couldn't attend their classes and examinations," said Kholiquzzaman, while presiding over the programme.

Bangladesh Diploma Engineers' Bangladesh president AKMA Hamid said the civil society should not stay as silent spectators amid this crisis. This is why this national convention has been arranged, engaging people from all walks of life.

Economists Ibrahim Khaled, sector commander Abu Usman Chowdhury and security analyst Abdur Rashid were present at the convention among others.
