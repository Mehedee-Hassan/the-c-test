Never bow down to anyone except Allah: Hasina
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said she will never bow down to anyone except Allah as she has nothing to lose.



She has also expressed her wish to work for the country as her father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman did for the land.



She was addressing a discussion at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre in Dhaka on Saturday, marking 39th day for assassination of the Father of the Nation Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.



Ruling Awami League organised the programme.

Prime minister said, "I've nothing to be scared. What do I've to lose? I've lost mother-father and members of my family. What I'm getting or what I'm losing doesn't matter. What I'm doing for people is the real question. I wish after my death I'll visit my father [in the world beyond the death] and tell him that I've worked for the people of Bangla who loved you."

Addressing the party activists and leaders, she said, "People of this land give us a chance. We want to make this country hunger- and poverty-free using every second."

The prime minister became emotional while remembering Bangabandhu. She said it was punishable to mention the name of Bangabandhu for long 21 years. No one dared to talk about Bangabandhu in radio and televisions. If any one showed courage to mention Bangabandhu, he/she were subjected to torture. They, [ruling parties] however, failed to erase the name of Bangabandhu from public memory.
