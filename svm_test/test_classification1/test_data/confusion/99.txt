Sustainable dev needs gender equality, says CSW prep meet
Sustainable development cannot be achieved without gender equality. This has been the key message of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). And in the 60th session of CSW to be held on 14-24 March 2016 at the United Nations headquarters in New York, the priority theme will be women’s empowerment and its link to sustainable development.



On 28 February (Sunday), UN Women in Bangladesh organized a preparatory meeting for the 60th CSW session. State minister for women and children’s affairs Meher Afroze Chumki MP was special guest on the occasion.



Chaired by Christine Hunter, country representative of UN Women, the meeting was also attended by secretary, women and children’s affairs Nasima Begum, Ayesha Khanam, Advocate Salma Ali, Shaheen Anam and other leading personalities of the women’s movement in Bangladesh.



Meher Afroze Chumki MP pointed to the achievements attained by the government in the sector of women’s development as well as the challenges.



She said that Bangladesh had made strides in poverty alleviation, women’s empowerment, primary education for the girl child and more. However, violence against women, child violence and child marriage still remained a challenge.



The minister appealed to all to put on a united front when representing Bangladesh at the coming CSW session to be held in March in New York.



Christine Hunter highlighted the priority given to women’s empowerment in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). She said that the clear message was that there could be no sustainable development without gender equality. She said the review theme of the session would be the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls. The participating members would take account of what has and has not been done in this regard.



Speaking on gender inequalities across the economic, political, social and environmental dimensions of sustainability, Bangladesh Mahila Parishad president Ayesha Khanam said that these issues were to be taken up by both the government and the civil society. She said that the women’s development policy that had been formulated was now forgotten and needed to be brought to the forefront once again.



She pointed to the increasing number of women in various sectors of employment. They needed housing, transport, daycare facilities and more. The state had a lot to do in this area. She also highlighted the need to address security and violence issues pertaining to women.



Advocate Salma Ali, executive director of Bangladesh National Woman Lawyers’ Association (BNWLA) said that the government had passed good laws regarding domestic violence and trafficking, but the challenge was in the implementation of the laws. She pointed out that Bangladesh hadn’t fully ratified CEDAW and this needed to be addressed.



Shaheen Anam said that the coming CSW session in New York was significant as it was the first session after the adoption of the SDGs. Though two of the sustainable development goals specifically focused on gender equality, the issue was very much a part of all the goals.



The discussants at the programme also included Umme Shefa Rezbana of CPD, Dr Abul Hossain of the ministry of women and children affairs, Jowshan A Rahman, Ranjan Karmakar and others.
