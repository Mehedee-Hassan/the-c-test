Draft child marriage bill ready: minister
State Minister for Women and Children Affairs Meher Afroz Chumki on Monday said the draft of the Child Marriage Restraint Bill is almost ready, modifying the existing Act of 1929.

“There will be no scope to increase the age by affidavit during marriage and no affidavit will be accepted while registering any marriage,” she said while addressing Bangladesh Girl Summit-2014 at Osmani Memorial Auditorium in the city.

Visiting Parliamentary Under Secretary of United Kingdom for International Development Lynne Featherstone, Founder of BRAC Fazle Hasan Abed, and Women and Children Affairs secretary Tarik-ul-Islam also spoke at the function.

The state minister said penal provision will be included to the new bill to punish parents and marriage registrars for arranging and helping in child marriage.
