AL, BNP to stage showdown in city Saturday
Tension has gripped the city dwellers as the ruling Awami League and BNP are going to stage their separate programmes in the capital on Saturday.

Despite a possible face-off between their supporters, the two parties are determined to hold their scheduled programmes.

As part of their month-long programme to mark the mourning month, Awami League will hold a rally at Suhrawardy Udyan in the afternoon, marking the assassination of Bangabandhu and his most family members.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to address the rally as the chief guest.

On the other hand, the BNP-led 20-party alliance will form a human chain from Bijoynagar crossing to Notre Dame College at noon, marking the ’International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearance’.

Earlier, the ruling party has called upon BNP to postpone their programme as it coincides with their rally.

Though BNP did not put off their programme, it has shifted the rally venue from the Press Club to Bijoynagar crossing. The programme will begin at 11am and will continue for an hour.

However, the Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) did not give the alliance permission for the programme.

Contacted, BNP joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said they have sought permission from the DMP authorities. “We’re yet to get the permission, but we hope they will allow us to hold our peaceful programme,” he told UNB around 8pm today.

BNP’s Dhaka city unit convener Habibun Nabi Khan Sohel said they are all set to hold their programme peacefully. “We hope the government will permit us to stage our programme.”

On Monday, Rizvi announced the programme at a press briefing at the party’s Nayapaltan central office.
