BNP conspiring for fresh polls: AL
The ruling Awami League’s joint general secretary Mahbub-Ul-Alam Hanif has said the BNP is plotting anew to destabilise the country, demanding mid-term elections.

"The BNP has been trying to destabilise the country with taking up different issues. They are now putting forward the demand for holding interim elections as part of the anti-state conspiracy," he said after paying tribute to Sheikh Kamal marking his 66th birth anniversary by placing wreaths on his grave at Banani in the capital.

"When the country is heading towards development and peace and got the status of mid-income country, the BNP-Jamaat clique has been plotting one after another to make the country a failed state," he also said.

"They started their conspiracy to push the country into darkness with assassination of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman along with his family members on 15 August in 1975," he opined.

Calling upon all to remain alert against the evil force, the AL leader said, "They are still active to pursue their evil design."
