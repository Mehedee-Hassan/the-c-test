Zia escaped trial by embracing death: Hasina
Mentioning that former President Ziaur Rahman, also founder of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), had a link with the killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Monday that it was better that Zia had died, otherwise he would have to face trial in the murder case.

“After the tragic assassination of Bangabandhu, the politics of killing, coup, conspiracy and grabbing power illegally had begun in the country. And General Ziaur Rahman was the mastermind of such kind of politics,” she said.

“Zia had a link with the killing of Bangabandhu and he must have made an accused in the gruesome murder had he been alive,” she said.

Sheikh Hasina, also the Awami League president, said this while delivering her introductory speech at a joint meeting of Awami League Central Working Committee, AL Advisory Council and AL Parliamentary Party at her official residence in Dhaka in the evening.

Prime minister said through the killing of Bangabandhu and the four national leaders, conspiracies were hatched to turn Bangladesh into a subservient state of the anti-liberation forces.

“Khandakar Moshtaque, who murdered Bangabandhu, appointed Zia as the army chief. Zia used to like Moshtaque and it means that Zia had a link with the killing of Bangabandhu,” she said.

Sheikh Hasina said Khandakar Moshtaque could not stay in power more than two and a half months due to the conspiracies of Zia. “The “Monafeq” (betrayer) usually experiences such consequence,” she said.
