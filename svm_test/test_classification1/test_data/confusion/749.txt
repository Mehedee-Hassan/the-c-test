Chinese firm gets main Padma Bridge work: Quader
Communications Minister Obaidul Quader on Monday said China Major Bridge Engineering Company got the main construction work of the much-talked-about Padma Multipurpose Bridge.

He came up with the disclosure while addressing a discussion at Awami League President’s Dhanmondi political office in Dhaka.

Juba Mahila League, an AL associate body, organised the discussion marking the Homecoming Day of AL president Sheikh Hasina.

Hasina returned home on May 17, 1981 after six years in exile following the assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family members in 1975.

Obaidul Quader said the technical evaluation committee awarded the work to China Major Engineering Company after scrutinising all the tender bids. The work order will be given to the company within the next three weeks.
