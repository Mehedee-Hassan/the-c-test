BNP’s call for anti-terrorism national unity a joke: Tofail
BNP’s campaign for anti-terrorism national unity is a joke as they are still allied with Jamaat-e-Islami, said commerce minister Tofail Ahmed.



The minister said this at a press conference at the ministry on Thursday where he announced the $ 37 bn export target for the running fiscal year.



Tofail Ahmed said that he is displeased with BNP’s continued involvement with Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami.



He says that BNP must be joking if it calls for national unity while being affiliated with such a group.



The minister said that people of Bangladesh won their independence by turning every home into a fortress. He urged the people to turn their homes into fortresses once again to fight terrorism.
