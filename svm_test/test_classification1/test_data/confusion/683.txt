Teachers' demo for lack of knowledge
Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith on Tuesday said the university teachers are demonstrating against the new pay scale for the public servants due to dearth of knowledge.

He added that the teachers' programme to abstain from work has no justification as, Muhith claimed. they have no idea about what the new scale has offered to them (teachers).

The minister was speaking to the newsmen at the secretariat, about the implications of the new pay scale, endored by the cabinet on Monday.

“I can't understand exactly how they were dishonoured,” Muhith regretted.

He also underlined the need for addressing the "corrupt practice" committed by the university teachers.

The minister said: “Every professor gets promoted without much hassle and eventually they promote the associate professors according to their whim. It was noticed that there are 10 lecturers whereas above them, one thousand professros are posted."

"Does it make sense? It is not fair that only those at the upper echelon (of teachers) would be promoted.”

The finance minister mentioned that the relevant cabinet committee would be duly informed of this.

“We'll control the university staff the way we manage the bureaucracy,” Muhith said.
