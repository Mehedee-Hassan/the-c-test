How far will 'exception clause' protect girls?
Senior UN officials and representatives of foreign diplomatic missions and international agencies have questioned how far the child marriage restraint act will actually provide protection, given the exception clause being retained by Bangladesh government. They also pointed out that the Beijing Declaration made it clear that religious or cultural traditions could not be used as excuses to violate women’s human rights.

Speaking at a programme organised at a city hotel by UN Women yesterday, Friday, representatives of the ‘Ambassadors for Change’ campaign stressed the need to increase investment in various programmes to prevent violence against women. They also highlighted the need to involve men and boys in the programmes to prevent violence against women. They called for a ‘zero-tolerance’ policy regarding violence against women.

Representatives of the ‘Ambassadors for Change’ campaign spoke to the media in between various programmes marking the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence. The child marriage issue featured prominently during the exchange of views.

UN Assistant Secretary General and UN Women Deputy Executive Director Lakshmi Puri, visiting Bangladesh as part of UN Women’s leadership to globally mark the 16 Days of Activism against gender-based Violence, met with relevant key stakeholders including government officials, heads of international agencies and diplomatic missions and the media.

Speaking to the media at the programme, she said, “Bangladesh has made important strides and is internationally recognised for its strong achievements in the Millennium Development Goals including girls education, parity, primary and secondary education, and also maternal health.” She lauded prime minister Sheikh Hasina as a champion of gender equality.

Lakshmi Puri said that despite its achievements, Bangladesh still had a long way to go to achieve full equality for women. The country had high prevalence of violence against women and girls, particularly domestic violence and child marriage. She pointed out that child marriage was also a form of violence against women. It is an anachronism to have child marriage. The costs were too high. Laws to protect women had to be implemented. Educational institutes and workplaces needed to be safe places. She said parents gave their underage daughters in marriage to protect them, but instead the girls faced physical and mental harm. It was more important to give them a safe environment in which to grow.

Lakshmi Puri said, deep-rooted social norms and gender stereotypes have to be challenged and changed. Underlying these norms were inequality, discrimination and disempowerment. The Beijing Declaration made it clear that cultural excuses couldn’t be used to violate women’s human rights.

Elaborating the 16 Days for Activism, she said that it began on 25 November, the international day for the elimination of violence against women and ends on Saturday, 10 December, which is the Human Rights Day. She said, “On these 16 days we drew world attention to this pandemic, this public health pandemic, this human rights violation pandemic. This is something we are here to shed light on and spur action. This year in particular we focus on the need for raising money, raising investment for ending violence against women in all its forms.”

Speaking on the occasion, US Ambassador Marcia Bernicat said, “The government of Bangladesh's revision of the 1929 child marriage restraint act incorporates some new provisions to toughen the legal framework regarding child marriage, including tougher penalties. However the introduction of the exception clause runs the risk of impeding the end of child marriage in Bangladesh.” She said ending child marriage was a key element in ending gender based violence. Child marriage and gender violence were very closely linked.

Ambassador Bernicat said, “The use of child marriage which is sometimes proposed as protecting girls, puts them at risk. It makes the girl child vulnerable physically, emotionally, and economically. Child brides, moreover, usually go on to become child mothers. These young mothers are two times as likely to die of pregnancy and child birth related complications due to their incomplete physical development. These under-aged mothers are far more likely than adults to suffer from obstetric fistula. And ironically these girls with obstetric fistula are at greater risk of becoming victims of gender violence.”

The US Ambassador pointed out that Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka have all revised their child marriage laws and set the minimum child marriage age at 18 without exceptions. Referring to developed countries that have laws permitting child marriage, she said these laws were archaic and inconsistent with human rights norms. “And I am not aware of any developed country enacting a new law that permits child marriage,” she added.

Sri Lankan high commissioner Yasoja Gunasekera said that violence against women was an international problem, not a problem of one particular country. “We can look at it from an economic perspective,” she said, “It has been estimated that the cost of violence against women globally is equal to 2% of the global GDP (or 1.5 trillion dollars). That indicates if the world invested only 2% of that cost (i.e. 2% of 1.5 trillion) we could virtually eliminate VAW – so a great savings in economic costs, human suffering and an enormous contribution to gender equality.”

Also present at the question and answer session with the media were senior diplomats of foreign missions and representatives of international agencies in Bangladesh.
