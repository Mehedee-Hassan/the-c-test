BIRDEM doctors' work abstention continue


Work abstention, called by the doctors of Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation for Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders (BIRDEM) in protest against the assault on their colleagues, is going on for the second consecutive day on Wednesday.

The doctors at a press conference at BIRDEM hospital auditorium about 10:00am on Wednesday said the work stoppage would continue till the persons involved with the attack are not punished.

The doctors went on the work stoppage since Tuesday protesting at an assault on their colleagues by the relatives of a patient Sirajul Islam who died on Sunday.

The work stoppage caused sufferings to the patients coming for outdoor services.

Ahmed Salam Mir on behalf of the doctors claimed that they do not want sufferings of the patients, but now they cannot carry out duty properly as they feel insecure.

Sirjul Islam's daughter Farhana Nasrin claimed that doctors went on work stoppage to hide their misdeed. They were not attacked by anyone.

BIRDEM physician Faruk Pathan said in the press conference that the accusation of wrong treatment is not true. Sirajul Islam was under his treatment from 2010. He was suffering from critical diseases.
