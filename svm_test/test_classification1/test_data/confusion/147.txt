ICDDR,B's new medicine for malnourished children
The International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) has formulated a medicine with local ingredients for the treatment of children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM).

Scientists of the organisation said that their research indicated that 80% of the children who took the drug, are no longer malnourished and are gaining weight.

The medicine has been formulated for children between 6 months and five years.

However, two leading nutritionists of the country have objected to the medicine medicine. Professor MQK Talukdar said there are possibities of commercial use and abuse of the medicine. Bangladesh Breast Feeding Foundation chairperson SK Roy said the medicine would have a long-term adverse affect on the state of child nutrition.

The effectivity of the medicine was discussed during the opening session of an international symposium on nutrition at the ICDDR,B in Dhaka on Monday.

Leader of the research team and ICDDR,B nutrition centre chief, Tahmid Ahmed, said the difference of the medicine with a commercial drug is that the medicine is prepared with local food ingredients.

Scientists and nutritionists said the medicine is called as 'ready-to-use therapeutic food' (RUTF), and it is used to treat severe acute malnutrition in children.

Some African countries use the medicine, produced in the name Plumpy'Nut by a French company. But, the Indian government has banned administering Plumpy'Nut to children in the face of resistance from public health specialists and nutritionists.

The ICDDR,B scientists formulated the medicine with a mix of rice, lentils or chickpeas, powdered milk, sugar, soyabean oil and micronutrients.

The dehydrated mixture is packed in a polythene packet, and can be preserved for a year at room temperature. A 100-gram packet provides 500 kilo calories of energy. The food supplement is to be administered according to the age and weight of the child.

Tahmid Ahmed said, the study was carried out on a total of 327 children with malnutrition at the ICDDR,B Mohakhali hospital, a Terres Des Homes clinic at Kurigram and a Radda Barnen clinic in Dhaka.

The international standard research took about two years to be completed. No child died during the research, and 80% of the children overcame malnutrition, while each child gained weight taking RUTF.

Sudden deficit of protein, energy, vitamins and minerals, reduce fat and muscle tissue in a child's body, causing severe acute malnutrition. This syndrome exposes children to diseases, and also death.

About six lakh (600 thousand) children in the country are victim of SAM. The drug RUTF addresses this syndrome. Parents, especially from rural areas, cannot easily bring their children for treatment to the hospitals. Thus RUTF is can be used to to save the malnourished children in the rural areas.
