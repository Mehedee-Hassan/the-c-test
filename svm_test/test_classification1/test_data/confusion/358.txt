A five-day director-general-level border talks between Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and Indian Border Security Force (BSF) began at BGB Pilkhana headquarters in Dhaka on Saturday, reports UNB.

As part of the conference, a friendly basketball match participated by the members of the two border guards was held at Dhanmondi Basketball Gymnasium in the evening but the talks will kick off formally at the BGB headquarters around 9:30am on Sunday, said public relations officer of the BGB headquarters Mohsin Reza.

The talks will end on Wednesday.

BGB DG major general Abul Hossain will lead the 28-member Bangladesh delegation while BSF DG Shri KK Sharma will lead the 19-member Indian team.

The Bangladesh side will give more emphasis on border killings in the conference like the previous DG-level conference, said Reza adding that various border-related issues, including the smuggling of drugs and arms and ammunition, are likely to come up for discussion at the conference.

The two sides will sign a joint record of discussions (JRD) of the conference on completion of the border talks.
