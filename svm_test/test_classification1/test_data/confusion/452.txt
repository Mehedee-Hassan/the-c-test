The Society of Plastic Surgeons of Bangladesh (SPSB organised the four-day conference.

Sheikh Hasina alleged that the BNP-Jamaat terrorists have created a horrific situation across the country in the name of their movement.

"The movement is not working and being effective as the people are not responding to it. That's why they (BNP-Jamaat) are creating panic among the people by hurling petrol bombs at them," she said.

Health minister Mohammad Nasim and state minister for health Zahid Maleque were present at the function as special guests.

SPSB president Dr Samanta Lal Sen, secretary of the health ministry Syed Monjurul Islam, SPSB secretary general Dr Md Abul Kalam and chairman of the conference organising committee Prof Brig Gen (retd) Anjan Kumar Deb also spoke.
