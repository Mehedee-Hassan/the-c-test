‘Bangabandhu’s ideology couldn’t be killed’
The prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, on Thursday said Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated on 15 August but the killers could not kill his ideology and none would be able to do so in the future.

The premier came up with the remarks while inaugurating a photo exhibition, ‘Chitragathay Shokgatha’ at the South Plaza of the Jatiya Sangsad complex in the capital, marking the 40th anniversary of death of the country’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

The Dhaka North City Corporation has organised the three-day exhibition.

Terming 15 August, 1975 a black chapter in the national life, Hasina, also the president of ruling Bangladesh Awami League, said, “We have lost not just our father of the nation in the 15 August assassination but also the spirit of Liberation War. The constitution saw its dissection and even the history was distorted after the 15 August killing.”

After 1975, Hasina noted, people could not utter Bangabandhu’s name. “The history was distorted and people had no right to hear the Liberation War songs. The trial of the war criminals was halted, while the convicted war criminals were freed from jail and made prime minister, ministers and advisers.”

Sheikh Hasina also vowed to turn Bangladesh into a hunger- and poverty-free ‘Sonar Bangla’ as dreamt by Sheikh Mujib so that the country could move ahead on the global stage.
