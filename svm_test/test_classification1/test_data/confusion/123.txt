Girls’ marriage age cannot be below 18
There will be no such thing in the Child Marriage Restraint Act which might encourage marriage of girls under 18 years, health minister Mohammed Nasim said.

The minister added that girls under 18 cannot be married off at any excuse as child marriage has to stop across the country.

Mohammed Nasim was addressing a Prothom Alo roundtable at its Karwan Bazar office on Saturday.

Supported by World Vision and Child Rights Advocacy Coalition, the roundtable was anchored by Prothom Alo associate editor Abdul Quayum.

The health minister at the roundtable also conveyed a concept over the Child Marriage Restraint Act, saying, “There will be no ifs and buts in the Act. No loophole will be provided in the law for the opportunists. Marriage cannot be held under 18 years even on health grounds.”

Bangladesh as a child marriage-prone country is ranked fourth in global perspective.

The law operating in Bangladesh to combat child marriage was issued in 1929 as Child Marriage Restraint Act.

For updating the law, the cabinet approved a draft of Child Marriage Restraint Act 2014 on 15 September last year.

According to the draft, minimum marriageable age of girls is remaining 18, but with parental consent this can be lowered to 16.

The government is re-considering the option after its decision to lower the minimum age to 16 faced a volley of criticisms.
