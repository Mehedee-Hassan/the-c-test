Univ teacher held for slander
A university teacher in Khulna was held on Thursday on charge of slander against Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, President Abdul Hamid and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

Sonadanga police arrested Northern University Khulna branch teacher Rajib Hasnat Shakil, an assistant professor of the law department, on the campus at about 2:00pm.

The law enforcers also detained campus in-charge Anwarul Karim, who was later released after being quizzed.

Meanwhile, the campus was declared closed for an indefinite period after the deputy commissioner asked for keeping its academic activities closed until further notice.

Police said the arrest was made following a case filed with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court of Dhaka on Wednesday.

Bangabandhu Foundation president Abdul Malek filed the case for making derogatory remarks about the important persons of the state.

According to the case statement, Shakil made disrespectful comments against Bangabandhu, the President and the Prime Minister while delivering lecture in his classroom on January 26 this year.

Nayeem, one of the 13 students who attended the class, stormed out of the class protesting the remarks.

Later, Nayeem was expelled from the university and he was not allowed to register for the next semester.

The incident came to light on June 29 when Nayeem spoke at a press conference at Khunla Press Club.

He also sought the intervention of the President and the Prime Minister in getting back his studentship, and demanded justice.

Meanwhile, accused teacher Shakil denied the allegation, saying Nayeem staged a drama using him to go back to the main campus of the university in the capital.
