2-3 Bangladeshis involved in plot to abduct Joy: Minister
Home minister Asaduzzaman Khan on Sunday claimed 2-3 people from within Bangladesh were involved in the conspiracy to abduct and kill prime minister’s son Sajeeb Wazed Joy.



He came up with the disclosure while talking to newsmen after a discussion at BILIA Auditorium at Dhanmondi in the city, marking the historic Mujibnagar Day.



Asked on what grounds senior journalist Shafik Rehman was arrested, the home minister said, “You (journalists) know everything …there was a plot to kidnap and kill our ICT adviser Sajeeb Wazed Joy in the USA.

Those who were arrested there in connection with the plot had conversations with 2-3 people in Bangladesh. Shafik Rehman might have link with them.”



About the two other people involved in the conspiracy, he said this could be known very soon.



Detective Branch of Dhaka Metropolitan Police arrested Shafik Rehman from his Eskaton Garden residence on Saturday morning in a case filed with Paltan police station in August last year for plotting to abduct and kill Joy in the USA.



Rehman is being interrogated by DB as he is now on a five-day remand granted by a Dhaka court on Saturday.
