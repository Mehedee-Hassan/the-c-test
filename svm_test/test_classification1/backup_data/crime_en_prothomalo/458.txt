Prosecution submits charges against 3 'Razakars'
The prosecution of International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) on Sunday submitted formal charges against three alleged 'Razakars', Sheikh Sirajul Haque alias Siraj Master, 72, Khan Akram Hossain, 61, and Abdul Latif Talukder, 68.

Prosecutors Syed Sayedul Haque Sumon, Jahid Imam and Sheikh Mosfeq Kabir submitted the reports to the office of the registrar at about 2:00pm today.

"We have brought a total of 8 charges of crimes against humanity against them," prosecutor Sumon told BSS.

The three alleged 'Razakar' leaders from Bagerhat were detained recently after the ICT-1 issued warrants to arrest against them on June 10.

According to the prosecution, they three were trained by the Pakistan occupation army in Khulna Ansar Camp and set up 'Razakar' camps in different areas of Bagerhat. Subsequently they committed killings, genocide, rape, lootings, arson, forced conversion from those camps.

The first tribunal also set tomorrow to pass an order on whether to initiate trial in absentia against Syed Md Hasan alias Hachen Ali and appoint a defence counsel to represent the fugitive accused.

The ICT-1 on April 3, issued arrest warrant against Hachen, infamously known as 'Razakar Daroga' for his war time role at Tarail area in Kishoreganj. But the law enforcing agencies are yet to nab him.
