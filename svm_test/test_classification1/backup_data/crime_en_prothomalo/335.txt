Female member of gold smuggling syndicate held
Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) arrested an alleged female member of an international gold smuggling syndicate and recovered 12 gold bars worth around 1.2 kg from Abdullahpur bus stand of Uttara in the city on Friday night, reports news agency UNB.

Sources at the RAB-1 battalion headquarter said based on secret information, a special team of the battalion led by ASP Md Nazmul Hasan raided a Benapole-bound bus at Abdullahpur bus stand at around 11:20 pm.

The elite force had information that a female member of the gold smuggling syndicate known as Parul Begum was about to leave Benapole for Kolkata along with the gold consignment.

Searching the bus, the elite force identified the suspected female member Paul Begum and recovered the 12 gold bars from her possession.

During preliminary interrogation, she reportedly revealed that smuggled gold has been sent to India using Bangladesh as transit route for a long time. Earlier, she went to India several times with gold bar consignments, said a Rab official.
