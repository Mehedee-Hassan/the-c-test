4 foreigners held over lottery fraudulence
Members of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) have arrested four foreign citizens over complaints of lottery fraud using mobile phone.

The arrestees were swindling large amounts of money through cheating, according to a text-message sent to media houses by the RAB.

The SMS reads the RAB seized the mobile phones, laptops and SIM cards which were being used in the fraudulent acts.

Details of the arrestees and the fraudulence will be unveiled at a press briefing at RAB’s Media Centre in the city’s Karwan Bazar soon.
