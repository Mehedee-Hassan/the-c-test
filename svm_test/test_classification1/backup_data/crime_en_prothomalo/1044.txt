Doctors confirm rape of Garo woman
Medical tests conducted on Garo woman, who was allegedly gang-raped in a moving microbus on Thursday night, have found evidence of rape, doctors said.

The 22-year-old woman underwent the tests at the forensic department of Dhaka Medial College Hospital at 11:00am on Saturday.

The department head Prof Habib-Uz Zaman said that they had found proof of rape in medical tests.

"She's very weak. We'll submit a complete report in a week over the tests."

The victim filed a case on Friday afternoon against five unidentified rapists.

Sub-inspector of Bhatara Police Station Khurshed, quoting the case statement, told UNB that the Garo woman was dragged into the microbus by the miscreants from Kuril Bus Stand around 9:30pm on Thursday as she was waiting for transport to return home after the day’s work at a showroom in the area.

After the abduction, the microbus kept running around the locality and the miscreants, numbering five, raped her one after another.

Later, the miscreants threw her out of the bus at Jasimuddin Road in Uttara on Thursday midnight. Local people rescued her and took her to a local hospital, according to the case statement.
