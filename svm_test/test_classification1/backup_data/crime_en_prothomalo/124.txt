JL leader caught red handed for rape
Police arrested a Jubo League (JL) leader on charge of raping a minority child in Baniachang upazila of Habiganj early Saturday.

The arrestee, Shamsul Mia Chowdhury, 32, is a senior vice president of the upazila’s Kagapasha union unit Jubo League. Shamsul Haque is father of two children.

The victim child is undergoing treatment in a local hospital.

Local people caught the JL leader red handed last night, but let him leave the place as Shamsul Haque threatened them.

On Saturday morning, mother of the victim child filed a case against Shamsul Haque. Later police held the Jobo league leader.

Family members of the victim said Shamsul Haque broke into their house when the child was asleep in the room, and violated the child.

As the child burst out crying, mother of the child rushed to the room and found Shamsul violating the child.

Responding to the hue and cry at the house, local people rushed to the spot and they also found Shamsul in the room.

Shamsul Haque then threatened witnesses not to make any protest.

Former UP member Mahmud Ali said Shamsul Hauque is a JL leader, also a member of an influential family in the area. This is why the local people do not protest at his activities.

Mother of the children said Shamsul Haque threatened her not to file any case against him. He wants to settle the issue through local arbitration, she added.

Baniachang police officer-in-charge Nirmalendu Chakraborty said mother of the victim filed a case today, Saturday. Police arrested Shamsul Haque.
