Ex-Coast Guard DG arrested on graft charge
The Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) arrested former director general of Bangladesh Coast Guard Shafiq-ur-Rahman in connection with a Tk 70 million fund embezzlement case on early Thursday from the capital.

An ACC team led by its deputy director SM Rafiqul Islam conducted a raid on the Mohakhali DOHS residence of Shafiq-ur-Rahman and arrested him, said ACC public relations officer Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya.

He added the ex-DG was charged for embezzling around Tk 70 million funds meant for purchasing 11,100 tonnes of wheat, reports news agency UNB.

The case was filed against five people, including the ex- chief of Bangladesh Coast Guard, with the Bureau of Anti-Corruption (Bac), now defunct, in 1998 for embezzling the Tk 70 million fund.
