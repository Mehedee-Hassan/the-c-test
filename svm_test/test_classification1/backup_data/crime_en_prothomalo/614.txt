UK BNP leader Mujib, driver testify in court
Bangladesh Nationalist Party's UK chapter leader Mujibur Rahman and his driver Rezaul Haq Sohel, who went missing on May 4, gave their deposition before a local court on Thursday.

Chief Judicial Magistrate Shyamkanta Sinha separately recorded the statements of Mujib, former vice-president of UK BNP, and Rezaul in the afternoon.

Criminal Investigation Department of police produced the BNP leader and his driver before the court.

Miscreants set free Mujib and Sohel at Tongi, Gazipur on August 18, nearly three and a half months after they had gone missing.

Family sources said Mujib and his driver went missing on their way to Sylhet from Sunamganj after attending BNP’s mass hunger strike programme on May 4.

The two had gone missing amid growing incidents of abductions and killings across the country, including the sensational adductions and murders of seven people in Narayanganj.
