Khaleda conspiring again to kill me: Hasina
Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday alleged that her arch-enemy Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Khaleda Zia with her vow to hold election without Hasina has demonstrated that she is conspiring again to kill her through an attack like the 21-August one, reports UNB news agency.

"What Khaleda Zia is trying to say through holding election without Sheikh Hasina? It's my question. Is she conspiring again to kill me through grenade attack or any other means like the August-21 one," said Hasina, also the president of ruling Awami League.

Sheikh Hasina, also the President of the ruling Awami League, was delivering her introductory speech at the AL Central Working Committee meeting held at her official residence Ganobhaban in the evening.

The prime minister chaired the meeting.

She alleged that Khaleda is hatching a new conspiracy as she has no other way-out. “She always looks for the lone path.”

Hasina also referred to the attempt of killing her through planting two powerful bombs at Kotalipara in Gopalganj. "They (BNP) don't understand any other thing, except conspiracy."

The prime minister said although the BNP and Jamaat made attempts time and again to kill her, it was Almighty Allah who always saved her. "Almighty Allah gave me a new life with more responsibility. So, as long as my task remains unfinished, I believe Allah will safeguard me."
