A team of ACC Khulna regional office, led by its director AKM Jayed Hossain Khan, went to LGED local office in Rampal at about 12:30pm and arrested upazila engineer M Nuruzzaman who was taking Tk 20,000, allegedly bribe money, from one Rainbow Enterprise proprietor Golam Azam who had earlier informed ACC about Nuruzzaman's demand of bribe, said ACC public relations officer Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya.
