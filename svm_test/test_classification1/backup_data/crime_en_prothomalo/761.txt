BNP condemns police attack on protesters
The BNP on Monday condemned the police attack on the demonstration of Bangladesh Chhatra Union, protesting sexual assault on women on Dhaka University campus.

It is very disgraceful to come across such police action on female students, BNP's international affairs Secretary Asaduzzaman Ripon said.

He was addressing a press briefing at party’s Nayapaltan central office in the city.

“We are concerned over the police action on the procession of a progressive student’s organisation. It is shameful,” Ripon said.

He said the BNP believes that everyone has constitutional rights to protest, demonstrate or stage rally peacefully.

“But, the illegal government cannot tolerate any protest,” he alleged.
