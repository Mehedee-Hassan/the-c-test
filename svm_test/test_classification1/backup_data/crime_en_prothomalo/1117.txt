Members of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) in an overnight drive held six people over Moghbazar triple murder from different parts of the capital in the hours of Saturday.

The identities of the six persons could not be known immediately.

It was understood that a team of the force held the six along with two pistols and three sharp weapons.

During preliminary interrogation, the held persons confessed to RAB their direct involvement in the triple murder, said RAB Headquarters director (Media wing) Commander Mufti Mahmud.

On the night of August 28, miscreants gunned down three people, Ranu Akhter Brishti, wife of Mohammad Abul Hossain, her younger brother Hridoy’s friends, Munna, and Billal Hossain and injured another in a house at Sonalibagh in the city’s Moghbazar area following a rivalry with local land grabbers and extortionists.

Later, on August 30, a case was filed against 15 people, including Shah Alam Khandakar alias ‘Kala Babu’ as main accused, with Ramna Police Station in connection with the murder.

On September 15, ‘Kala Babu’ was killed in a ‘shootout’ with detectives near Moghbazar Wireless level-crossing in the city.
