Sayedee among 146 indicted for vandalism
A Dhaka court on Monday indicted 146 leaders and activists of Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir in a case filed for vandalism in 2013.

Shibir’s former president Delwar Hossain alias Sayedee and Jamaat’s executive committee member Dr Shafiqul Islam Masud are among the accused.

Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Mohammad Tareq Mainul Islam Bhuiyan framed the charges against them and fixed October 12 to start the trial with the deposition of witnesses.

The court also issued a warrant for the arrest of 47 Jamaat-Shibir men as they did not appear before it during the hearing.

According to the case statement, the Jamaat-Shibir men brought out a procession in the city’s Motijheel area on February 12, 2013.

Obstructed by police, the Jamaat-Shibir men vandalised several vehicles and blasted a number of crude bombs in the area, creating panic among people.

Later, police filed a case with Motijheel Police Station on that day.
