Nizami shifted to Dhaka jail ahead of verdict
Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami was shifted to Dhaka Central Jail from Kashimpur Jail in Gazipur on Tuesday ahead of the verdict on the trial of war crimes, reports UNB.

The International Crimes Tribunal-1 is set to pronounce its judgment on Wednesday in the war crimes case against the Jamaat chief.

Nizami was taken out of ‘Nilgiri Bhaban’ of the Kashimpur High Security Jail in the evening, said jailer Jannatul Farhad of Kashimpur.

The prison van carrying Nizami reached Dhaka Central Jail at about 8:00pm, said its jailer Forman Ali.

Earlier, the announcement of judgment was deferred thrice on different grounds since November 13 last year. The reconstitution of the tribunal, rehearing on summing-up arguments from both sides and sudden sickness of the accused in custody are among the reasons behind the delay.

Nizami was indicted on May 28, 2012 with 16 counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, genocide, loot, rape, incitement, planning, abetment, and killing intellectuals during the Liberation War.
