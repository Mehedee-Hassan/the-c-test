Legal notice served on Muntassir Mamoon
A legal notice has been served on historian Muntassir Mamoon, The Daily Janakantha editor Atikullah Khan Masud and its executive editor Swadesh Roy, seeking Tk 12 crore as compensation for terming a Hindu leader a ‘Jamaat secretary’.



Advocate Afsana Begum, on behalf of advocate Gobinda Chandra Pramanik, secretary general of National Hindu Grand Alliance, sent the notice through registered post on Tuesday morning.



The notice said the vernacular daily published a column written by Muntassir Mamoon on 20 June where he described Gobinda Pramanik as the religious affairs secretary of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami.



Terming Muntassir Mamoon an ‘intellectual fraud’ and Masud and Swadesh his associates, the notice said they intentionally defamed Gobinda through the article.



It also demanded Tk 4 crore as compensation from each, asking them to pay the compensation within seven days from receiving the notice.



It was mentioned in the notice that the trio was asked to offer apology by 27 June at a press briefing at Dhaka Reporters Unity earlier. As they did not respond to the call, the notice was served on them.
