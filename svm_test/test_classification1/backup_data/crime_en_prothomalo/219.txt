Amanullah Aman denied bail in 44 cases
A Dhaka court on Wednesday turned down bail petitions of BNP joint secretary general Amanullah Aman in 44 cases filed for obstructing police from discharging their duties, arson attack on vehicle and vandalism during the BNP-led 20-party alliance’ s blockade and hartal program.

Dhaka Metropolitan Session Judge M Kamrul Hossain Mollha passed the order after hearing on his bail petition.

On August 5 and 6, Aman’s advocate Sanaullah Miah filed two separate petitions seeking bail in the 44 cases.

On August 2, the BNP leader was sent to jail after he surrendered before a lower court seeking bail in 56 violence cases.

Of the 71 cases, Aman was granted bail in seven cases filed with Paltan, Motijheel, Jatrabari, Khilgaon and Savar police stations while the hearing on eight more cases was deferred as the case documents were not produced before the court.
