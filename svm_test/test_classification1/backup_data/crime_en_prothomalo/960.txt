Hearing on arrrest of Mahmudur in Joy case on 25 Apr
A Dhaka court on Monday fixed 25 April for hearing a petition filed by DB over showing Amar Desh acting editor Mahmudur Rahman arrested in a case filed in connection with a plot to ‘abduct and kill’ prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s son Sajeeb Wazed Joy.



Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Golam Nabi fixed the date when senior assistant commissioner of the detective branch (DB) Hasan Arafat, also investigation officer of the case, filed the petition before the court.



The IO also sought a 10-day remand for Mahmudur, now in jail in separate cases.



Police arrested Mahmudur Rahman from his Karwan Bazar office on 11 April 2013.



On 16 April last, the Dhaka CMM court placed senior journalist Shafik Rehman, former editor of Bangla daily Jaijaidin, on a five-day remand in the same case.



On 3 August 2015, a case was filed against Mohammad Ullah Mamun, vice-president of BNP's cultural wing Jasas, for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to abduct and kill Sajeeb Wazed Joy.



According to the case statement, Mamun along with some top leaders of BNP and its allies met at different places in Bangladesh, including Jasas office, and the USA before September 2012 and conspired to abduct and kill Joy.



However, only Mamun was named as an accused in the first information report (FIR) of the case.



After filing of the case it was transferred to DB for investigation and Fazlur Rahman was made investigation officer of the case.
