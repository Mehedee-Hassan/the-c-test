Proposal placed in parliament to declare 25 Mar ‘Genocide Day’
A proposal has been placed before parliament to declare 25 March as Genocide Day to show due respect to the people killed in the liberation war of Bangladesh in 1971.

Speaker Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury said the proposal will be discussed on 11 March in parliament.

“I’ve already received a proposal demanding the declaration of 25 March as Genocide Day by a member of parliament,” she added.

In the current parliamentary session, prime minister Sheikh Hasina told the parliament to take initiative to mark 25 March as Genocide Day.
