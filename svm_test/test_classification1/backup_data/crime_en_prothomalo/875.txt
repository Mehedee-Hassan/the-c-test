Barisal police officer suspended for bribery allegation
Barisal Metropolitan Police (BMP) deputy commissioner (north) Zillur Rahman has been suspended for his alleged involvement in raising bribe fund for promotion.

The home ministry issued a notification in this regard on Wednesday.

The ministry took the action on charge of violating discipline, misconduct, corruption and damaging the police department’s image.

The suspended deputy commissioner has been attached to the Deputy Inspector General (DIG) office, Sylhet range.

“Zero tolerance is our stand against offenders. If a policeman is found involved in corruption he would be identified as an offender to us, not a policeman,” inspector general of police (IGP) AKM Shahidul Haque was quoted as saying by assistant inspector general (media) of police headquarters Mohammad Nazrul Islam.

“Such policemen won’t be spared and the process will continue,” said the IGP.

Earlier, at least 10 policemen of BMP were suspended for collecting bribe money for use for the promotion of some police constables, ASIs and havilders.

After primary investigation, a team of detectives found the involvement of Zillur Rahman, deputy-commissioner (north), for encouraging the suspended police officials to raise fund to purse the cases of promotion.
