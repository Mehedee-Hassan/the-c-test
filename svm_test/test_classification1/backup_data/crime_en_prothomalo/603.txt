Cop among 3 killed in Sirajganj road crash
Three people, including a police constable, were killed in a road accident near Koddar intersection of Bangabandhu Bridge (west) connecting road in Sirajganj Sadar on Wednesday.



One of the deceased was identified as police constable Abdul Based, 43, but the identity of the two others, one a bus driver and another a truck driver, could not be known immediately.
