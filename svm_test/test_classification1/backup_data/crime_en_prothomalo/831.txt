Besides, maximum life-term sentence or up to 12 years of imprisonment along with additional fine would be awarded in case of any "grievance hurt" to bride by bridegroom side associating with the demand of dowry.

He said, any one filing case on false accusation of demanding dowry would be sentenced to one-year jail or maximum Tk 50,000 fine or both.
