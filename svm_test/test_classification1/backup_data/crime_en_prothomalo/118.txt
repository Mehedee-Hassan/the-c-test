‘Raped’ child doing well: Physicians
The five-year old girl, who was raped and tortured in Dinajpur's Parbatipur, is doing quite well, said physicians.

Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) paediatric surgery department chief Ashraful Haque on Saturday said her condition is now stable.

“She’s doing well and taking food. Her genital infection is under control. We don’t need to worry much about spreading of her infection. Overall, her condition is now stable,” he said.

Ashraful Haque informed the Prothom Alo about the child after visiting her at one-stop crisis centre at the DMCH.

He also said the nine-member team that was formed for the minor child’s treatment will take its next course of action regarding her treatment next Thursday.

Earlier on Tuesday, the child was admitted to the DMCH with marks of torture and genital injury.

She was badly tortured and raped and the rapist scarred her genitals with sharp object, bit her and seared her thighs with burning cigarette, said the physicians.

On 18 October, the girl went missing, and she was found badly injured in the next morning in a nearby field.

Later, she was admitted to Rangpur Medical College Hospital.

A certain Saiful has been arrested in this connection. The victim's family said Saiful was previously known to the child.
