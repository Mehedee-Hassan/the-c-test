War crimes accused Ahmed Ali dies
War crimes accused Ahmed Ali of Netrakona died at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) early Thursday. He was 78.

Sources at the DMCH said Ahmed who had been suffering from old age complications breathed his last around 12:30am.

Ahmed Ali, a resident of Sunaikanda in Purbadhala upazila of Netrakona district, was admitted to the DMCH around 8:45pm on Wednesday.

Earlier on August 13, the International Crimes Tribunal-1 sent Ahmed Ali, arrested for his involvement in crimes against humanity during the Liberation War in 1971, to jail.

The ICT-1, led by Justice M Enayetur Rahim, passed the order when prosecutor Mokhlesur Rahman Badal produced him before the tribunal.

When the tribunal asked the accused about his role during the Liberation War, Ali confessed to his involvement with the Peace Committee that worked for Pakistani Army.

He told the tribunal that he had dug earth for the Pakistani occupation forces and carried their guns.

In 2013, freedom fighter Abdul Quadir of Barohaganakpara village filed a written compliant with the tribunal against 7-8 suspected war criminals where he alleged that Ali had been involved in abducting seven people, killing, looting and carrying out arson attacks during the Liberation War.
