The held income tax official is Zahid Iqbal Khan, chief assistant of zone-4 of income tax office at Agrabad commercial area, according to ACC official.

The ACC teams recovered the bribe money from Zahid, he added.

It was understood that Zahid had demanded Tk 20,000 from Kashem Bhuiyan in exchange of clarifying his file.
