Barisal BCL leader accused of forgery
A legal notice has been served on Bangladesh Chhatra League Barisal city unit president Jasim Uddin accusing that he got admission at graduation level presenting counterfeit SSC and HSC certificates.

The notice was issued on behalf of Md Al Imran, a student of political science department at Brazamohan College, also a BCL activist, on Wednesday.

The notice reads that Jasim took admission in a BSS honours course of Barisal College through certificate forgery in 2010.

Denying the allegations, Jasim Uddin told Prothom Alo, "The notice was served to smear my political image. I duly passed the examinations."

Al Imran said, "Jasim's relative is my friend. I know Jasim passed under madrassah education board. But he submitted SSC certificate issued through Timirakathi High School."

Government Barisal College principal AKM Mujibur Rahman said, "I have received a copy of the legal notice. The education board will be liable for certificate forgery. However, the National University authorities will cancel his admission if the forgery is proved."
