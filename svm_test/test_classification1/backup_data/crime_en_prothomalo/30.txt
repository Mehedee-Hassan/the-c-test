RAB slams police website
The Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) have claimed that Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) is spreading 'intentional and fabricated hoax' through its website to undermine the RAB credibility.

RAB at a rejoinder letter circulated to the media on Monday criticised a report published on the DMP news, an online Bangla news portal of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, and said that the report on RAB officials was published to tarnish the image of the elite force.

Dmp news [www.dmpnews.org] on Monday publish the report, where the headline read in English: "Now 18 RAB members withdrawn for embezzlement."

RAB headquarters' legal and media wing director Wing Commander ATM Habibur Rahman circulated the protest letter on behalf of the director general of the elite crime bustling force.

In the letter, the RAB official termed the Dmp news report "intentional and fabricated."

It reads: " the shameless falsehood regarding the officials of a government law enforcing agency circulated at a government agency that is renowned and acclaimed does not only tarnish the image of the former agency, but also seriously harms the confidence and spirit of the members of the concerned force. Moreover, attitudes of concerned officials embarrass everybody."

It further added that "The highest level of transparency and accountability is always ensured in the elite force RAB. In line with the trend, if allegations are found against any RAB member, those are considered urgently and scrutinised under the existing laws. In this process, the RAB members are either withdrawn from one unit or attached to another unit for the sake of scrutiny in most of the cases."

"We're requesting the concerned people to refrain from spreading confusions intentionally over the attachment of some RAB 3 members to another unit. We also request to communicate with the concerned officials of the particular force while publishing such reports in future," the protest letter concluded.
