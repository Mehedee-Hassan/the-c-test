Bangladesh didn’t make clear its stance on lowering girls’ marriage age
Bangladesh has not made clear its stance on lowering the age of girls’ marriage in its periodic report on its implementation of the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child submitted to the United Nations.

It, however, said in the report that the country targeted to end child marriage under the age of 15 by 2021 and under 18 by 2041.

The UN committee on the Rights of the Child on Wednesday concluded its consideration of the fifth period report presented by the state minister for women and children affairs minister, Meher Afroze Chumki, according to a note released by UN Human Rights office at Geneva.

Presenting the report, the state minister said the government of Bangladesh attached utmost importance to ensuring that every child grew up properly with equal opportunities and became a worthy citizen in the future.

Mentioning that the child marriage is very common in Bangladesh in the report consideration meeting, a committee expert asked about the measures taken by Bangladesh to eliminate the child marriage.

In response, the Bangladesh delegation led by the state minister noted that the legal age of marriage in Bangladesh was 18 years for girls and 21 years for boys. “In a recent meeting, on 15 September 2014, the cabinet had reviewed the updated draft of Child Marriage Restraint Act, which had now been approved in principle.”

The delegation also said despite those recent developments, a large proportion of marriages admittedly still took place before the legal age of marriage was reached. “Early and forced marriage, therefore, still remained as a big problem in the country, especially among the lower income groups living in rural and hard to reach areas.”

Noting that the prime minister was strongly committed to end child marriage in the country, Chumki said that the country targeted to end child marriage under the age of 15 by 2021 and under 18 by 2041. “To realise such a target, the government drafted a five-year National Plan of Action, addressing all the relevant issues associated with the child marriage,” she added.
