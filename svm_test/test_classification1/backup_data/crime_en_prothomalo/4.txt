Police officer Jahid, source remanded in police custody
Police sub-inspector Jahidur Rahman and his source Nasim Sheikh have been remanded in police custody for five days to be quizzed in a custodial death case.

Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Md Mahbubur Rahman on Thursday granted five days for interrogating the police officer and his source against the ten days of interrogation sought by Detective Branch inspector Nibaron Chandra Barman.

Mirpur police sub-inspector Jahidur Rahman, who was suspended after allegations were made against him, was held by Mirpur police at Shialbari in Mirpur on Wednesday.

Sub-inspector Rafiqul Islam Khan on Thursday morning filed a case against eight people, including Jahid and Nasim, with the Mirpur police for allegedly beating up young garment waste trader Mahbubur Rahman Sujan after taking him in police custody on July 13.

Following the torture Sujan fell sick and was first admitted to a local clinic and then shifted to Suhrawardy Hospital where doctors declared him dead in the morning of July 13.

Earlier, sub-inspector Jahid arrested Mahbubur Rahman in the city’s Shankar locality in the early hours on July 13.

As family members of the victim alleged that Sujan was tortured to death, SI Jahid was closed to Rajarbagh Police Lines later in the day. An unnatural death (UD) case was then filed with the police station.

Police sources said Mirpur police received the post-mortem report of Sujan on Wednesday evening, which revealed Sujon died due to ‘homicide’ that prompted the authorities to arrest SI Jahid.
