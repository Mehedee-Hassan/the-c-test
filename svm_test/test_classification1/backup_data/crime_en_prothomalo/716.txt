Ershad a neo freedom fighter, ridicules BNP
In a counter-attack on Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad for accusing Ziaur Rahman of destroying the Liberation War spirit, BNP on Thursday branded him as a neo freedom fighter.

“Ershad has emerged as a new freedom fighter. We don’t have any interest in talking about him. It seems he gets importance when we speak about him,” said BNP acting secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir.

The BNP leader came up with the remarks while addressing a discussion at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh arranged by Jatiyatabadi Swechchhasebak Dal, marking the ‘National Revolution and Solidarity Day’.

Earlier on Wednesday, addressing a rally at Laldighi Maidan in Chittagong, Ershad alleged that Ziaur Rahman had destroyed the spirit of the Liberation War though he was a freedom fighter, and said BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia is one step ahead as she awarded the national flag to the vehicles of the anti-liberation forces.

Reacting to his remarks, Fakhrul also said Ershad had been in Pakistan during the country’s Liberation War. “He had been made the first deputy army chief and later the army chief due to Ziaur Rahman’s magnanimity.”

Terming the Jatiya Party chief a traitor, he said there is a question what was Ershad’s role in the Zia killing.”

The BNP leader said it does not suit Ershad’s mouth to criticise the ‘proclaimer of independence’ as the country’s people have already ditched him with hatred.

Mentioning that Ershad had removed an elected government led by Justice Abdus Sattar after the assassination of Ziaur Rahman, Fakhrul also blamed him for destroying democracy.

He said the former military ruler who unleashed the steamroller of repression on the country’s students and people to cling to power by force got the title of the scum of the world. “So it doesn’t fit your mouth to speak about democracy.”

“You’ve made yourself controversial and time and again….enough is enough, you please hold your tongue. Don’t belittle yourself further,” Fakhrul added.
