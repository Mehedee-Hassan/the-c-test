Madam, where is the $300 million: Joy
Prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s son Sajeeb Wazed Joy lashed out at BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on his Facebook account, asking her where was his $300 million.



Khaleda Zia on Saturday said that Sajeeb Wazed has 300 million dollars in his bank account and that it was documented in a case filed in the US.



In response to this remark, Joy posted on his Facebook: “A woman who has stolen money from orphans, one whose son is a fugitive accused by the FBI for corruption, really should not be throwing mud at Bangabandhu’s grandson. Madam, if you know where the $300 million is, please let me know. I would like to donate it to orphans.”



“Your henchmen Mahumudur Rahman and Shafiq Rahman stole secret FBI documents listing all my bank accounts but could not find it. The military regime of 1/11 who arrested my mother could not find it. Even the FBI could not find it. That’s because I have never had anything close to $300 million. I am not that rich."



"Khaleda Zia on other hand, is a liar and a thief,” his Facebook status further read.
