The international Crimes Tribunal (ICT)-1 on Tuesday indicted fugitive 'Razakar' Syed Hasan Ali, alias Hachen Ali, infamously known as 'Razakar Daroga' for his heinous crimes committed during the War of Liberation in Tarail area of Kishoreganj.

"We are inclined to reject the petition submitted by the defence seeking discharge for the accused and hereby framing charges against him," said Justice M Enayetur Rahim, chairman of the three-member panel of the ICT-1.

The tribunal framed six charges of crimes against humanity against the alleged Razakar commander, including genocide, murder, abduction and torture.

The first tribunal set December 7 for placing the opening statement by the prosecution.

Earlier on October 22 and September 22, prosecutor Mohammad Ali took part in the charge framing hearing, while advocate Abdus Shukur Khan, state-appointed counsel for the fugitive accused, submitted a discharge petition.

The ICT-1 on September 15, through an order initiated trial against fugitive Hasan in absentia and appointed advocate Khan to represent the accused before court.

The investigation agency on June 29 presented the final report into investigation against the 'Razakar Daroga' to the prosecution. The probe agency had brought six specific charges of crimes against humanity against Hasan. The tribunal on April 3 issued warrant to arrest Hasan, but the law enforcing agencies are yet to nab him.
