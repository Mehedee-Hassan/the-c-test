Jubo League leader killed in Gazipur infighting
A Jubo League leader was killed in a factional clash between two groups of the ruling party supporters at a programme in Gazipur's Kaliakoir upazila on Friday.

The deceased is Mohammad Rafiqul Islam, former president of Kaliakoir upazila unit of Jubo League, the youth wing of ruling Awami League.

Officer-in-charge of Kaliakoir Police Station M Omar Faruk said local Awami League arranged a food distribution programme on the premises of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu College at Chandra on Friday afternoon marking the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 11th anniversary of 21 August grenade attack, says news agency UNB.

Liberation War Affairs minister AKM Muzammel Huq attended the programme as chief guest.

Soon after the minister left the venue around 5:00pm, two factions of the ruling party engaged in a clash over previous enmity.

Rafiqul was chopped with sharp weapons during the clash, leaving him critically injured.

He died on the way to hospital, said the OC.
