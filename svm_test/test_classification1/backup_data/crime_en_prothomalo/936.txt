13, including Mufti Hannan, indicted in CPB rally bombing case
A total of 13 members of banned Islamist organisation Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (Huji), including its top leader Mufti Abdul Hannan, have been indicted in CBP Rally Bombing case.

Dhaka's third sessions judge Imrul Kayes framed the charges on Thursday.

Five people were killed and 50 others injured in bombing a Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB) rally at Paltan ground in Dhaka on 21 January 2001.

Of the accused, Huji chief Abdul Hannan, Mainuddin Sheikh, Arif Hassan Sumon, Sabbir Ahmed, Shawkat Osman and Mohammad Moshiur Rahman are in jails while the remaining others — Abdul Hai, Shafiqur Rahman, Jahangir Alam Badar, Nur Islam, Mohibul Mustakin, Anisur Rahman and Rafiqul Alam — are still at large.

Two separate cases — one for murder and one under explosives act — were filed in this regard.

After 12 years of the attack, Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on 27 November 2013 submitted charge sheets in the cases before the court accusing 13 Huji members.
