100 days passed since Fahad abduction
A total of 100 days have passed since the abduction of Fahad Chowdhury, a stone businessman of Chittagong.

As the abductors did not demand any ransom, his family suspects that probably the law enforcers picked up him.

The police denied the allegation and said that they are trying to find out Fahad.

On 11 April, jewellery businessman Mridul Chowdhury of Chittagong was rescued six days after his abduction by the men who introduced them as RAB and police.

Later, Mridul placed Fahad second on the list of accused in a case filed in connection with looting 80 bharis of gold. RAB official Major Raquibul Amin was the number 1 accused in the case.

The family said some unidentified people picked up Fahad in a microbus from Kamalapur Balur Math area in Dhaka on 15 January.

Motijheel police sub-inspector Proloy Kumar said, "We are investigating into the matter. But we are yet to find his whereabouts.
