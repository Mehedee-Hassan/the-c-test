Women fall victims of land disputes
According to a statistics, at least 39% of acid-burnt people became victims in disputes centering lands and property. Ironically, most of the acid victims are women although they do not have land of their own.

According to the Acid Survivors Foundation (ASF), from 1999 to Novermber last year, 39% among the acid burnt were burnt in land disputes, 17% acid victims burnt in love affairs, refusal to marriage and physical relations and the other 12% burned in unidentified reasons.

Moreover, people are sustaining acid burnt injuries for dowry, complications in their conjugal lives and others.

ASF in its final report of 2012 said, from 1999 to November last year, at least 3,506 people became the victims of 3,179 acid throwing incidents. Among them, 2,405 were women and girls and 1,101 were men and boys. That means 69% among the acid burned were female.

ASF trustee board chairman Iftekharuzzam told Prothom Alo that earlier women became victims of acid violence centering love affairs, for refusal to love proposal etc. But now the women are being acid victims because of land-related disputes though the male members of the families mostly own lands.

It proves that in any kinds of rows, women are always at risk to become victims.
