2 arrested in city on charge of rape attempt
Police arrested two young men as they allegedly tried to rape a young pregnant woman in a microbus in the city’s Uttara area early Thursday.

The arrestees were identified as Rubel and Zahid. Further details of their identities are still awaited.

Deputy Commissioner (Media) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police Mutashirul Islam said the victim got down at Airport Railway Station from a train coming from Sylhet after Wednesday midnight.

While she was waiting for a vehicle at the nearby bus stop for going to Tongi, Rubel and Zahid approached her with their microbus asking her where she would go.

As the victim told them about her destination, they picked her into the vehicle saying they would drop her there. However, the two youths tried to violate the pregnant woman in the vehicle.

Meanwhile, a patrol team of Uttara East Police Station challenged the microbus at Uttara Sector-4 around 2:30am when the victim informed the law enforcers about her ordeal.

Later, police arrested Rubel and Zahid. A case was filed.
