14 syndicates run gold smuggling
The detectives have traced 14 syndicates, comprising some government officials, involved in gold smuggling.

According to the Directorate of Customs Intelligence and Investigation, a total of 2027 kilograms of gold has been seized in last 16 months since January 2013 and 80 people were arrested in this connection most of whom have been freed on bail.

Bangladesh is a safe route for international gold smugglers. Gold consignments from the Middle East are dispatched to a neighbouring country through Bangladesh.

Tax for every 10 gram of gold is Tk 150 in Bangladesh whereas the tax is around Tk 4000 in India. A smuggler makes around Tk 8 lakh profit if 10 gold bars can be smuggled to India.

A syndicate of government officials clear the way of illegal gold consignment through Dhaka and Chittagong airports.

Only a few consignments are caught due to internal conflict of the smuggling racket. Although many gold carriers are caught by the customs officials, but the ringleaders remain untouchable, said the DCII director general Mainul Khan.

He said that the DCII has no authority over the investigation into the cases filed against the gold smugglers. The police conduct the investigations without the officials who seized the gold.

The additional deputy commissioner of the Detective Branch of police, Md Mahfuzul Islam told Prothom Alo that, while investigating into a case, they detected 13 smuggler syndicates. They got information about another gold smuggling cartel while probing another case.

But most of cartel members cannot be traced because the arrested carrier persons do not know their names. The gold carriers know only the persons from whom they receive the gold and they are asked to wait for a phone call from an unknown person to hand over the consignments. So, it is tough to identify the persons in the smuggling chain.
