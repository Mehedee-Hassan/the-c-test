TSC sexual assault not a matter of serious concern, says minister
Ruling Awami League leader and shipping minister Shajahan Khan on Tuesday said the incident of sexual harassment on the Dhaka University campus during the last year’s Bengali new year celebration was “not a matter of serious concern.”



“Such incident is usual. It can happen,” noted the minister while addressing a programme at the Dhaka University campus.

A civic platform called Natun Dhara organised the programme to accolade reception to what it called brave women for their outstanding contributions, marking the International Women’s Day.



Addressing there as the chief guest, the minister tried to downplay the seriousness of the incident and said the Pahela Boishakh is the first day in the Bangla calendar.



“People flock to the streets on the day. Some two crore people live in the capital city of Dhaka. What kind of an alarming incident has occurred in such a huge crowd that could be (used as) an item for news. A trifle incident can take place. This [sexual harassment in Bengali new year celebration] incident among such a huge crowd is not a big deal,” observed Khan.



To justify his observation, the shipping minister referred to the developed countries and said: “Incidents bigger than this one take place in the developed countries. Those are more fatal than this.”



He was critical of those who criticised the government for the incident. “They try to say that the government has failed to maintain the law and order.”

The minister went on saying, “There are many countries in the world where women are considered consumer products and many countries don’t give the rights to women.”
