18 RAB personnel sent back to duty
The Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) on Tuesday sent back its 18 members from its headquarters to RAB-3 a day after their withdrawal over an allegation of “embezzlement".

A RAB official told Prothom Alo on Tuesday that some RAB-3 personnel were attached to the headquarters following some allegations and sent back to the battalion after quizzing them.

The elite crime bustling force on Monday morning closed 18 officers and members of RAB-3 to the RAB headquarters for their alleged controversial activities. RAB-3 company commander Major Ali Ahsan was among them.

Later, the DMP news [www.dmpnews.org], an online Bangla news portal operated by Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP), published a report where the headline read in English: "Now 18 RAB members withdrawn for embezzlement."

But the RAB headquarters officially said that the RAB personnel were attached to the headquarters as a part of regular reshuffle in the elite force.

The elite force in a rejoinder letter circulated to the media on Monday night sharply criticised the report published on the DMP news.

A RAB official, seeking anonymity, told Prothom Alo on Tuesday night that on the basis of receiving allegations against them, the 18 RAB personnel were closed and attached to the headquarters for the sake of investigation. After the completion of quizzing them, they were sent back to their duty.
