Suspected robber killed in Narail ‘gunfight’
An alleged robber was killed in a reported gunfight with police in Pohordanga Balumath area in Kalia upazila early Sunday.



The deceased was identified as Mizan Kazi, accused in several cases, including for robbery and arms.



Acting on secret information that a gang of robbers were taking preparation to commit robbery, a team of police launched a drive in the area around 2:30am, said Noragati police officer in-charge Mahbubur Rahman, reports news agency UNB.



Sensing the presence of police, the robbers opened fire on the law enforcers, prompting them to retaliate, triggering a gunfight.



Mizan received bullet injures and died on the spot, added the OC.



Police also recovered a shutter gun, four rounds of bullet and two machetes from the scene.
