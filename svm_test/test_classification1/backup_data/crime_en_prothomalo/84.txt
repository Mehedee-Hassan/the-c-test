Biman adds 2 aircrafts for domestic flights
Biman Bangladesh Airlines is all set to resume its full fledged domestic operations from 6 April following a procurement of two new aircrafts from Egypt.

Biman will operate more than 120 domestic flights per week which will see a huge growth in domestic operations by the flag-carrier after a long recession, sources said.

According to sources, Biman will operate six flights to Cox's Bazar, five to Jessore, three to both Rajshahi and Syedpur, and two to Barisal every week.

The operation will add up to 25 additional frequencies per week on Chittagong and Sylhet routes and the number of seats will increase almost by 80 percent.

On Friday, the two newly procured aircrafts arrived at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 2.20pm and 2.30pm respectively, a BBA spokesperson told BSS.

Prime minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to inaugurate the two aircrafts formally for commercial operations on 5 April.

Earlier, Biman Bangladesh Airlines signed an agreement with Smart Aviation of Egypt for procuring two Dash 8 Q400 aeroplanes on lease for a period of 5 years.
