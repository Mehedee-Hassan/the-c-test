Jamaat calls 24-hour nationwide hartal from Wednesday
Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami has called a 24-hour nationwide hartal (general strike) beginning 6:00am Wednesday, protesting what the party said "the government conspiracy to kill its secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed."

Hours after the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld death penalty for Mojaheed, the party's acting ameer Makbul Ahmed in a press statement announced the hartal programme.

Earlier on 17 July 2013, the International Crimes Tribunal-2 sentenced the Jamaat secretary general to death, and some other sentences for separate charges in connection with the crimes he committed during the Liberation War of 1971.

Mojaheed served as social welfare minister in the cabinet of the BNP-led alliance govenment during the 2001-2006 tenure.

Claiming that Mojaheed was deprived of justice in the trial and the people got disappointed with the verdict, the party announced the hartal programme.

"We are announcing 24-hour nationwide general strike beginning 6:00am Wednesday protesting the government conspiracy to kill Mojaheed and demanding release of all of the top leaders of the party," read the press statement signed by the party's publicity wing member M Alam.

The party called on the people from all walks of life to make the progamme a success.
