4 held over DU admission test forgery
Two examinees were detained for resorting to unfair means during the ‘Gha’ unit admission test of Dhaka University (DU) on Friday.

Abdus Salam and Jubaidul Islam were held from Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Government Boys’ High School and Motijheel Government Girls’ High School centres as they were answering the question with helps received through their mobile phones.

Earlier on Thursday, two people, identified as Md Milton and Md Pavel, were arrested from in front of Jagannath Hall while they were making a deal for forgery in the admission test.

The exam was held at 87 centres across the capital, including on the DU campus, on Friday.
