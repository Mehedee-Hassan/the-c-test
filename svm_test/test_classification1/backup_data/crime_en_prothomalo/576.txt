Tarana sues Sangskritik Jote leader for forgery
State minister for posts and telecommunication Tarana Halim has sued Bangabandhu Sangskritik Jote general secretary Arun Sarkar Rana allegedly for collecting money counterfeiting her signature.



Tarana herself is the president of the jote, a cultural front of the ruling Awami League.



The case will be sent to the anti-corruption commission (AC) because the charge is to be dealt with, by the organisation, said Shahbagh police officer-in-charge Md Abu Bakar Siddique.



According to the statement, Arun had collected money from various persons and organisations using the junior minister's name and post, counterfeiting her signature on the pad of Bangabandhu Sangskritik Jote without her permission since 2014.
