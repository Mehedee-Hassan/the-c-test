BNP movement part of global terrorism: Ashraf
Local government and rural development minister Syed Ashraful Islam on Wednesday claimed the ongoing agitation programmes called by BNP-led 20-party alliance is part of international terrorism.



"We have declared war against religious militancy, not only in Bangladesh but across the globe as well," said Ashraf, also general secretary of ruling Awami League, while inaugurating a truck rally of Muktijoddha Sangsad Central Command Council.

The rally of one hundred trucks, starting at Manik Mia Avenue and ending at the National Parade Ground, was organised protesting nationwide hartal and indefinite blockade.

"Many countries, including Paris, Libya, Egypt and Denmark, are facing the same turmoil like us. The ongoing unrest in Bangladesh is part of this global terrorism," said the minister.

"I urge everybody to combat this international terrorism in unison, otherwise human race will be at stake," Ashraf observed.

Speaking at the programme, shipping minister Shahjahan Khan said, "Khaleda Zia has become blind and deaf. She can't see the abysmal condition of the nation."

Among others, liberation war affairs minister AKM Mozammel Haque spoke at the rally presided over by Maj Gen (retd) Helal Morshed Khan, chairman of the council.
