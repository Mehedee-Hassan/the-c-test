I didn’t blame entire ministry: AJM Nasir
The Chittagong City Corporation mayor, AJM Nasir Uddin, on Saturday said he did not accuse the entire Ministry of of Local Government, Rural Development (LGRD) and Cooperatives of seeking bribe against allocating funds.



“One can’t blame the whole administration for the deeds of individuals and I didn’t blame the entire ministry as well. Those who are bringing the issue of government’s image to this matter are doing it deliberately,” AJM Nasir told a media briefing held at the Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry.



At a programme at the Chittagong Theatre Institute on 10 August, the mayor alleged that the city corporation didn’t get sufficient allocation from the ministry as he refused to pay five per cent bribe to certain ministry officials.

“My allotment [allocation for the city corporation] would have been Tk 300 to 350 crore had I paid the bribe,” he said.

In response to mayor’s claim, the ministry the next day sought explanation from mayor AJM Nasir Uddin over his comments.

Asked whether he could give proof of his claim, the mayor said, “The proof is a different matter. I will reply what I have to reply. Whether I can do it or not is up to me. There is no scope of twisting the matter now.”

He went on saying, “A lot of issues come up in an academic discussion. I didn’t go for filing any written complaint against anyone. I am a politician. I need to answer questions like why the work of projects has not yet finished.”
