Papiya sent to jail on surrender
Former BNP MP Syeda Ashifa Ashrafi Papiya was sent to jail on Tuesday in connection with nine cases filed for vandalism and arson attacks.

Three Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrates -- Maruf Hossain, Mahbubur Rahman and Mostafizur Rahaman -- passed the orders when she surrendered before the courts on completion of her High Court bail.

Of the nine cases, five were filed with Paltan Police Station and three with Mirpur Police Station while one was lodged with Lalbagh police station.

All the cases were filed on charges of vandalising and torching vehicles during the three-month hartal-blockade programme enforced by the BNP-led 20-party alliance on 6 January.
