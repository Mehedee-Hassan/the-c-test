Sobhan to face war crimes trial on 7 Apr
The International Crimes Tribunal 2 on Wednesday fixed 7 April for commencing war crimes trial of detained Jamaat-e-Islami leader Maulana Abdus Sobhan of Pabna, through examining the prosecution witnesses.

Tribunal 2, a three-member tribunal, headed by Justice Obaidul Hassan set the date after the conclusion of the opening statement by the prosecution.

On 31 December, 2013, the tribunal framed charges against accused Jamaat-e-Islami leader Maulana Sobhan for his involvement in crimes against humanity, including genocide, during the 1971 Liberation War, dismissing his discharge plea.

On 19 September 2013, after perusing the formal charge along with relevant statements and documents submitted by the prosecution, the tribunal took cognisance of the charges against Maulana Sobhan as it found a strong prima facie case against the accused under sections 3(2), 4(1) and 4(2) of the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973.

On 20 September, 2012, Sobhan, the number three man in the Jamaat-e-Islami hierarchy, was held by the members of an army intelligence agency at the Bangabandhu Bridge toll plaza in Tangail in connection with a case of violence. Later, the accused was handed over to the police.

The tribunal, upon a prosecution plea, had shown Sobhan arrested in connection with the case of the 1971 crimes against humanity.

According to the prosecution, it received allegations like genocide, rape, arson and looting perpetrated by Sobhan, the then leader of Pabna Peace Committee (collaborator) and Pabna district Jamaat ameer, in collaboration with the Pakistan occupation forces, including Razakar, Al Badr and Al Shams, during the Liberation War.

Sobhan had allegedly played a key role in organising Razakar, Al Badr and Al Shams, the auxiliary forces of the Pakistani junta, in Pabna district.
