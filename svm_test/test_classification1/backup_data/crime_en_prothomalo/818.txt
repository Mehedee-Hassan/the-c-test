Man kills wife, daughter in Satkhira
A young housewife and her minor daughter were strangulated to death allegedly by her husband over a dowry-related feud at Tarali village in Kaliganj upazila of Satkhira early Tuesday, reports news agency UNB.

The deceased are Sabina Khatun, 24, wife of Abdur Rauf, a resident of Ghona Kashempur village of the same upazila, and her two and half years old daughter, Ayesha Siddika.

Local people said Abdur Rauf had married Sabina, daughter of Anwar Hossain, a resident of Tarali village, three and a half years back.

Since after their marriage, Rauf had often tortured Sabina for dowry.

Later Rauf demanded a motorcycle from Sabina’s family.

The victim’s mother, Jahanara Begum, said four days ago when Sabina refused to bring the motorcycle as dowry from her parents, Rauf beat her.

Later, Sabina along with Ayesha moved to her father’s house.

On Monday night, Rauf came to his father-in-law’s house.

Rauf strangled Sabina and Ayesha at about 3:00am and fled the scene, leaving them dead on the spot.

The police recovered the bodies and sent those to Satkhira Sadar Hospital morgue for autopsy.

Police also arrested Rauf on Tuesday morning.

Officer-in-charge of Kaliganj Police Station Subhash Biswas confirmed the incident.

A case was filed in this connection.
