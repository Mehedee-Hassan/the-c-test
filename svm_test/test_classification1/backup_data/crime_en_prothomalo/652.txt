MP Bodi cleared of graft charge
The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has cleared Abdur Rahman Badi, a ruling party MP of Cox’s Bazar-4, of a corruption charge.



In a letter, ACC secretary Abu Md Mostafa Kamal informed all concerned about exonerating him from allegation of corruption in revenue and development projects during his tenure as Teknaf municipality mayor (2001-2005).



However, another case filed against him for accumulating asset from unknown sources is pending with the court. The ACC filed this case with Ramna police station last year.
