10-day remand sought for gang rape accused
Police on Thursday sought a 10-day remand for the two arrested over rape of a Garo woman inside a running microbus.

A remand petition has been submitted to the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court to this end.

The arrested are Ashraf Khan aka Tusher, 32, and Zahidul Islam aka Lavlu, 26.

On 21 May, the victim filed a case with Bhatara Police Station where she mentioned that five people had raped her inside a running microbus.

However, Rapid Action Battalion at a press briefing on Wednesday said it's the duo who had raped the victim.
