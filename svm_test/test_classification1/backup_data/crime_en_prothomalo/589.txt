Two burnt in N'ganj arson attack
Two people were burned as miscreants set fire to an Asian Transport bus in front of Bismillah Petrol Pump in Rupganj upazila of Narayanganj early Wednesday.

The injured are assistants of the bus driver, Shakil, 18, and Yasin, 20.

Most parts of Shakil’s body have been bunt while Yasin’s face and hands were burned in the incident.

The injured were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital burn unit.

Driver of the bus Md Jasim Uddin said Shakil and Yasin were asleep inside the bus when miscreants torched the bus at about 3:30am.

The bus might have been torched by gunpowder, the bus driver assumed.

If the bus had been torched hurling petrol bombs, there would be a sound of explosion. But It did not make any sound while it caught fire, the bus driver added.

DMCH police camp in-charge Mozammel Haque confirmed the admission of the Shakil and Yasin to the burn unit.
