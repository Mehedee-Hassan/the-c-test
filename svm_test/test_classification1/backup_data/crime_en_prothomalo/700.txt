Joy demands TIB's wealth statements
Sajeeb Wazed Joy, the ICT affairs sdviser to prime minister Sheikh Hasina, has demanded that staff members of the Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) show their wealth statements to prove they are not corrupt like their counterparts in Chile.



“If they have the courage, then they should voluntarily provide their wealth statements before they make any statements on corruption by others,” Joy said in a Facebook post on his official page.



He said anyone who wants to be a watchdog on corruption is required to provide their wealth statements to the Anti Corruption Commission, just as MPs are required to do.



“How do we know that the members of the Transparency International Bangladesh are not corrupt, that they do not have hidden wealth and have paid all their taxes?” Joy questioned.



He raised the issue of the recent resignation of the chief of Transparency International Chile who was named in the Panama Papers as having hidden wealth overseas.

“Then my question is, how clean is Transparency International and how do they have the right to call others corrupt?” Joy wrote in his Facebook post both in Bangla and English.





After all, in Bangladesh, he said, all members of parliament and ministers are required to provide their wealth statements. “Transparency International Bangladesh does not, yet they claim to be the watchdog on corruption.”

On 4 April, president of the Chilean branch of Transparency International Gonzalo Delaveau resigned after documents from a Panamanian law firm showed he was linked to at least five offshore companies.
