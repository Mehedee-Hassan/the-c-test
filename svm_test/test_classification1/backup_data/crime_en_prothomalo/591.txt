Truck driver, asst burnt to death
A truck driver and his assistant were burnt to death early Tuesday as miscreants hurled a petrol bomb at the truck on the Dhaka-Barisal highway in Gaurnadi upazila, relatives of the victims claimed.

The police, however, termed this an accident, not a bomb attack.

Relatives said the Barisal-bound truck carrying salt from Meghna ghat, came under attack when it reached Sundardi village in Gaurnadi at about 12:15am.

The driver Nur Hossain (35), a resident of Bauphal upazila, and his cousin Zafar Bari (30) of Dashmina upazila of Patuakhali, died of burn injuries on the spot, they added.

The police said the claims of the relatives of the victims should be investigated before reaching a conclusion about whether it was a bomb attack.

Naim Sikdar, a relative of victim Nur Hossain, said if the truck caught fire from the truck engine, there should have been a blast. "But that didn't happen," he claimed.

Zafar's relative Md Kamal Bari flatly said, "Zafar was killed in petrol bomb attack."

Gaurnadi police station officer-in-charge Md Sazzad Hossain said primary investigations showed it was an accident. However, they would be able to ascertain the matter once investigations were complete.
