Housewife hacked dead ‘by husband’
A housewife was hacked to death allegedly by her husband over a dowry-related conflict at Mohammadjuma village in Chuadanga Sadar upazila on Thursday midnight.

Quoting locals, police said Akash alias Mintu, son of Ramjan Ali of Tiorbila village in Alamdanga upazila, married Tahmina Khatun, 20, daughter of Sadar Ali of Mohammadjuma village six months back.

Mintu had been torturing Tahmina for Tk 50,000 and three bighas of land as dowry for the last few days.

When Tahmina’s father refused to fulfill his demand, Mintu sent her back to her father’s house.

On Thursday, Mintu went to their house and he killed Tahmina by slitting her throat over the issue.

Police arrested Mintu while fleeing from the spot, said Tozammel Haq, officer-in-charge of Sadar Police Station.
