Why not law for domestic helps: HC
The High Court on Tuesday issued a rule asking the government to explain why directives to take effective steps to frame a law for protecting the rights of domestic helps should not be given.

Responding to a public interest litigation writ (PIL) petition, an HC division bench, comprising Justice Salma Masud Chowdhury and M Habibul Gani, issued the rule, returnable in four weeks.

Cabinet division secretaries, Prime Minister's Office, women and children affairs, law and labour ministries have been made respondents to the rule.

Manzill Morshed filed the writ petition on behalf of rights group Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh (HRPB).

Emerging from the court, Manzill told reporters that there was no such law right now in the country to protect the rights of domestic helps. “They’re not even included in the labour law, he said. Adding, "As a result, the domestic helps are being deprived of their rights."
