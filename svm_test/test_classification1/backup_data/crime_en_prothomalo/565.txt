LGED engineer quizzed
The Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) on Thursday interrogated LGED chief engineer and vice-chairman of Bangladesh Central Freedom Fighters Council Wahidur Rahman and two others in connection with forgery of freedom fighter certificates.

ACC deputy director Farid Ahmed Patwari questioned them from 10 am to 2 pm at the ACC head office, ACC public relations officer Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya told UNB.

Bangladesh Central Freedom Fighters Council vice-chairman SM Mortuza Hossain and its office secretary Mahbubul Haque Chisty were grilled today since they recommended Wahidur Rahman as freedom fighter while collecting FF certificate.

During the interrogation, Wahidur was quizzed to know where he actually had taken in battle during the Liberation War in 1971 and where he received training in India before joining the war, an ACC source said preferring anonymity.

According to graft allegation received earlier by the national anti-graft body, Wahidur collected the FF certificate without properly fulfilling the procedure and got his job extended by two years with it.
