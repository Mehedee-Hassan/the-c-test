JnU student murder appears to be assault on free expression: PEN America
PEN America, an association of about 4,400 US writers, on Thursday condemned the brutal killing of a Jagannath University student saying it appears to be another “targeted attack by Islamist militants on those who express dissident viewpoints.”



“The persistent failure of the Bangladeshi government and the international community to better protect threatened thinkers has created a climate of fear and direct threat to free thought in the country,” PEN said in a statement released on its website.



The organisation said Nazimuddin Samad, whose writings on Facebook promoted secular themes and critiqued radical Islam, was attacked while walking home from an evening law school class at Jagannath University.



“According to the Dhaka Tribune,” the PEN America said, “witnesses said that the assailants chanting "Allahu Akbar" hacked Samad with machetes in the street before shooting him. The attackers, who appeared to know Samad's daily route, remain at large. Samad was not known to have received explicit threats prior to the murder.”



“We urge the Bangladeshi police and other authorities to do everything in their power to investigate and prosecute this vicious attack on free speech and thought, and halt this terrible pattern of murders. We also reiterate our demand for the United States and other countries that are able to provide refuge to shelter those writers who are still at grave risk before more lives are lost. This killing is a cruel illustration of the costs of inaction,” said Karin Deutsch Karlekar, director of Free Expression Programs at PEN America.
