Today's politics sick: Dr Kamal
Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain termed the current trend of politics "sick".

He made this remark while exchanging views with the leaders-activists of Gano forum Dhaka city unit at the central office of the organisation today (Saturday).

Remembering the historical 7th March speech, he said, "This speech showed people the way to freedom. We found our country and constitution because of Bangabandhu."

Today's politics have lost the way Bangabandhu once paved, he said.

"What we have today, is a sick form of politics." Dr Kamal said. Both petrol bomb killings and extra judicial crossfire killings are result of sick political practice, which should not be continued, he added.

"Many political leaders have their billboards out even before the election schedule is prepared. Where did they get all that money?" he questioned.

He also said during his tenure as the energy minister, he was not involved in any kind of corruption.

He gave references of the genocide of 25 March 1971 and Bangabandhu's assassination in 1975 and how people of this country woke up to defeat the forces behind those events." Bengalis do not surrender, they make the opposing force surrender," he said.

He also urged people to draw inspiration from Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's life. "Bangabandhu was never afraid of anything. So why are we so coward today?"
