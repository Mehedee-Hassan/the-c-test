Border killings to come down if cattle smuggling ends: BGB DG
The incidents of border killings will come down If cattle smuggling through the Bangladesh-India border ends as the blame for 90 percent of such killings goes to cattle smuggling, said Border Guard (BGB) Director General (DG) Maj Gen Aziz Ahmed.

"Cattle smuggling is the main reason behind border killings, and if this could be stopped then the border killings will effectively come down," said the BGB DG at a press briefing at the BGB headquarters here over the outcome of the recent BGB-BSF (Border Security Force) DG-level conference, held in New Delhi.

The BGB DG said a total of 26 Bangladeshi nationals were killed in border areas this year as of September and 22 of them were killed by the BSF.

During the conference, the BGB members urged their BSF counterparts to take necessary steps to stop cattle smuggling, he said.

The DG also said, "We've asked the BSF members to take necessary steps about illegal intrusion of BSF jawans."

About Yaba smuggling, the BGB DG said the BSF authorities assured them of taking steps in this regard as the smugglers use border routes for its smuggling.

Other issues related to drug and arms smuggling also came up at the conference for discussions, he said.
