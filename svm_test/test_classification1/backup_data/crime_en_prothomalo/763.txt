Don't call strike at will: Nasim
Health minister Mohammad Nasim urged the doctors not to abstain from working over trifling matter.

"Don't call strike over trivial ground. Who would take responsibility if a patient dies during strike?"

The minister was exchanging views with the physicians, staff and the management committee of the Rajshahi Medical College Hospital in its auditorium at noon today (Saturday).

He said that a real physician cannot stop working, and patient also cannot assault a doctor for a mistake in treatment.
