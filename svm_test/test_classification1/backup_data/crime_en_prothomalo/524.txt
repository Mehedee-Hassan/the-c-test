Finance minister lies: Barkat
Finance minister AMA Muhith commits intellectual fraud, tells lie without hesitation, lobbies illegally and has secured top position in committing nepotism, Janata Bank outgoing chairman Abul Barkat has complained.

He was addressing the launch of a book titled "Five years of Janata Bank's Corporate Social Responsibility 2009-13" at the National Press Club in Dhaka on Wednesday.

The public bank published the book to disclose its expenditures on CSR purposes.

Finance Minister has recently closed CSR programmes of four nationalised banks.

Abul Barkat, in a programme on Monday, said it was wrong to close the CSR programme and finance minister did so as he (Barkat) had not paid donations for a boat race in Sunamganj Haor area even after requests from Muhith.

Finance minister on Tuesday said Barkat had made the comment as he was not re-appointed chairman of the bank.

Muhith also added that he did not wrote to Barkat for donations.

In a reaction to the finance minister's comments, he said finance minister "committed intellectual fraud. Tell lies. He tell lies without hesitation and he is adept at telling lies."
