MIC, not AL govt’s credit: BNP
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Thursday said Bangladesh has been ranked a lower middle income country, thanks to sincere efforts by the people.

In its reaction to the World Bank’s ranking published on Wednesday, the party’s spokesperson Asaduzzaman Ripon pointed out that the Awami League government had no right to claim credit for the achievement.

“Rather the country could have reached the higher threshold of the middle income country, had there been no plundering of national resources during the reign of this government,” he expressed his views.

Asaduzzaman was addressing a press conference at the BNP’s central office in the city’s Nayapaltan area.

In this context, he gave a 72-hour ultimatum to the government to unveil list of the people who were involved in embezzlement of money form the banks.

“At least three Padma bridges could have been built with all those money,” said the BNP leader.

He said the country’s GDP would have been 7 per cent by now, had the AL regime not committed ‘so much of corruption’.
