RAB institutionally corrupt: Fakhrul
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) acting secretary general Fakhrul Islam said on Thursday morning that the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) has become corrupted institutionally.

He reiterated his claim of disbanding the elite force in a meeting held at the BNP central office at Naya Paltan in Dhaka.

Earlier, he met the BNP supporters and leaders of Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council.

He further said, referring to former RAB 11 commander Tarek Sayeed Mohammad's confession about his link with Narayanganj seven-murder, that for a long time BNP has been voicing its concern about RAB's involvement in unlawful activities. It should be disbanded, he added.

Fakhrul suggested that an effective force, which would not be involved in such unlawful activities, be formulated after disbanding RAB.
