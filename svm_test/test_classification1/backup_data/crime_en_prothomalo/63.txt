A minor domestic help, who was tortured allegedly by her employers at Mohammadpur in the capital, died at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) on Friday, reports news agency UNB.





The victim, identified as Hasina, 11, daughter of Abdus Sabhan of Kamilipur village in Dhobaura upazila of Mymensingh district, succumbed to her injuries at the hospital around 11:30am, hospital sources said.





Hasina had been working as a domestic help at the house of Shafiqul Islam at Kathpatti in Mohammadpur of the capital for the last three months.
