State machinery spreads corruption: Matia
Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury said on Saturday the state machinery is responsible for spreading corruption in the country.

She was speaking at the 'Satota Songher Somabesh O Shapoth Grohon' programme organised by Anti Corruption Commission, marking the Corruption Prevention Week at Osmani Memorial Auditorium in the capital.

"The state runs by an administrative framework. Corruption will decrease if the people meet with their basic needs," said the minister.

"The development partners of our country should practice ethics within themselves before advising us how to practice ethics," she added.

ACC chairman Mohammad Badiuzzaman said the Corruption Prevention Week is being observed to create mass awareness against corruption
