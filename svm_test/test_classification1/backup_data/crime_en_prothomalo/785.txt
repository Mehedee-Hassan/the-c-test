RU expels 3 BCL men over assault on engineer
The authorities of Rajshahi University expelled three leaders of the university unit of Bangladesh Chhatra League, student wing of Awami League, for lifetime on charge of assaulting an engineer on Tuesday night.



Professor Amjad Hossain, a member of the university syndicate, said the decision came at a syndicate meeting at night as the allegation against them was proved during investigation.



Those expelled are SM Towhid Al Hossain Tuhin, student of the finance department and former general secretary of the university unit BCL,

Tanmoyananda Avi and Mamun-or-Rashid, students of the fisheries department.



Earlier on August 28, 2014, the three BCL leaders allegedly assaulted acting chief engineer of the university Sirajum Munir at the waiting room of the vice-chancellor’s office over a tender-related dispute.
