Rape victim forced to leave home
A schoolgirl, who was raped by her teacher, and her father have been assaulted by the rapist's men and forced to move to their village home in Barisal.

Police and local sources said the teacher, who teaches at a school in the district's Kaliakoir upazila, raped the girl few days ago.

After the news spread out, he sought help of village leaders to cover the matter up.

On Sunday, the village leaders, including Anwar Uddin, Abul Hashem and Mosharraf convened village arbitration that ordered the rapist to pay the victim's family Tk 1.5 lakh in compensation.

As the rapist was unable to pay the money, he was beaten with shoes.

However, early Monday, the rapist and his men beat the victim's father and forced the whole family to leave for their village home in Barisal.

The headmaster of the school, Shafiqul Islam, told this correspondent that the rapist was asked not to go to the school.

The victim stopped attending her classes as well.

Village leaders Anwar and Abul Hashem said the rapist was supposed to pay the compensation on Monday.

The girl's family didn't come to collect the money, they said, adding they did know the teacher had beaten up the rape victim and her father.

While asked about the rationality of settling a rape case by beating and paying compensation, Anwar Uddin admitted that the teacher should have been handed over to the police.

Saiful Islam, sub-inspector of Mouchak police station, told Prothom Alo that no complaints have been lodged yet. Legal actions would be taken if a complaint is filed.
