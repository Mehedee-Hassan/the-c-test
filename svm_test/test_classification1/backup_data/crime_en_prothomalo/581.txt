Ex-minister, secretaries accused for crest forgery
The former liberation war affair minister and other high govt officials have been held responsible for the forgery in making gold crests awarded to Bangladesh's foreign friends, who contributed to the 1971 Liberation War.

The committee, formed to investigate into the forgery allegation, submitted its report to the minister for liberation war affairs AKM Mozammel Haque on Thursday.

The report accused former liberation war affair minister AB Tajul Islam, secretary of the ministry Mizanur Rahman and the former secretary KH Masud Siddique, additional secretary Golam Mustafa, joint secretary Md Abul Quasem, deputy secretary Enamul Quader Khan and senior assistant secretary Md Babul Mia, among others, of the forgery. The crests were awarded at reception programmes in Dhaka in honour of the foreign friends on the occasion of 40 years of the Liberation War.

Each of the crests was supposed to contain one bhari of gold and 30 bharis of silver. But the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution found only about three 'ana' of gold and three bharis of brass-copper-zinc alloy in one of the crests.

After Prothom Alo published a report on the forgery, the ministry formed the investigation committee which sent another crest for BSTI test. This time gold was found not at all in the crest.

The other accused in the report were auditor of the ministry Anisur Rahman, superintendent Aminur Rashid, audit and accounts officer Jasmin Akhtar, chief accounting officer Jahanara Parvin, assistant accounts officer Md Kamruzzaman and steno-typist Abul Quasem.

The suppliers of the substandard crests —Amicom and Messers Mohsinul Hasan — were also made accused in the report. Amicom supplied 258 and Mohsinul Hasan supplied 60 crests. Mohsinul Hasan told the investigation committee that former minister Tajul Islam is his maternal uncle.
