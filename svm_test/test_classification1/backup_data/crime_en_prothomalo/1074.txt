‘Robber’ killed in Satkhira ‘gunfight’
A suspected robber was killed in a ‘gunfight’ with police at Chhoyghoria in the sadar upazila early Friday.

The deceased was identified as Islam Morol, 45, son of late Yakubbar Morol of Patharghata in the upazila.

Tipped off that a gang of 15-16 robbers were preparing to commit robbery in the area, a team of police went to the spot around 3:30 am, said officer-in-charge of Satkhira Sadar Police Station Enamul Haque.

Sensing the police presence, the robbers opened fire on the law enforcers and hurled brickbats, prompting the police to fire back, triggering the gunfight.

Islam was caught in the line of fire and died on the spot, while his associates managed to flee the scene.

However, two police constables were injured in the gunfight.

Police recovered the body and sent it to Sadar Hospital morgue.

One shutter-gun and three sharp weapons were recovered from the spot.

Islam was wanted by police in several cases, including that of robbery and extortion, the OC said.
