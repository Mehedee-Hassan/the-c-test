Verdict on Hazari’s parliament membership 23 Aug
The High Court on Wednesday reset 23 August for pronouncing judgement on a ruling asking under what authority Nizam Uddin Hazari remains a parliament member, reports news agency UNB.



A High Court division bench comprising Justice Md Emdadul Huq and Justice Md Iqbal Kabir reset the date while seeking a document on how many days the Feni-2 lawmaker passed behind the bars in an arms case.



Earlier on August 3, the High Court set today, 17 august, for pronouncing judgement after conclusion of hearing on the ruling.

Barrister Shafique Ahmed and advocate Nurul Islam Shujon defended the Feni-2 lawmaker before the court, while advocates Kamrul Islam Siddiqui and Satya Ranjan Mondol stood for the petitioner.

Sakhawat Hossain Bhuiyan, a former leader of Feni district unit of Jubo League filed a writ challenging the legitimacy of Hazari’s portfolio as a lawmaker after a newspaper report brought into light the fact that Hazari allegedly took refuge in forgery in getting early release from jail.

The High Court on 8 June, 2014, issued the rule upon the government, the Election Commission and Hazari to explain in four weeks why Feni-2 constituency should not be declared vacant.
