Mother attempts suicide after killing child
A mother attempted suicide after allegedly hacking her 7-year-old child to death on Saturday in Rajshahi city’s Natun Budhpara.



The mother, Taslima Khatun, 45, has been admitted to the Rajshahi Medical College Hospital.



The deceased is Shahriar Alam Kabya, a Class I student of Sheikh Russel Model Primary School on the Rajshahi University campus.



Kabya’s father Rafiqul Islam is an assistant teacher at Meherchandi High School.



Matihar police station officer-in-charge Humayun Kabir said the mother with her murdered child were recovered from a room locked from inside. “It seems as if the mother tried to kill herself after killing her child.”

The police officer said they did not know the reason of the homicide but quoted locals as saying that the mother was mentally retarded.
