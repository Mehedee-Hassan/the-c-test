5 RU employees suspended on bribery charge
The Rajshahi University authorities suspended five of its staff on charge of taking money from university job seeks through fraudulence.

The decision was taken at a meeting of the RU Syndicate held on Sunday night.

The suspended staff members are upper division assistant of the university examination control office Shakar Chandra Saha, peon of the Department of Computer Science Sekander Ali, general staff of Ziaur Rahman Hall Khalid Hossain Sarder, peon of the Department of Physics Abbas Ali and that of the Department of Mathematics Habibur Rahman.

University sources said the five received huge amount of money from a number of university job aspirants promising them of giving jobs.

Later, the university administration formed an enquiry committee to investigate the misappropriation of money by the staff following a complaint by the job aspirants and their relatives against them.

RU Pro-Vice Chancellor Prof Chowdhury Sarwar Jahan said the five staff members have been suspended as the charges brought against them were proved during investigation by the enquiry committee.

He, however, said the suspended staff would be given several days so that they could defend themselves, adding that if they fail to give satisfactory reply within the period, they will be terminated from the job.
