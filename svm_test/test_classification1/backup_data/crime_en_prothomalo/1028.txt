No rape sign in Tonu’s first autopsy
Doctors at the Forensic Department of Comilla Medical College Hospital in their first autopsy did not find any sign of rape before the death of Comilla Victoria College student Sohagi Jahan Tonu.



“We didn’t find any sign of rape and it’s not even clear how she was killed,” Dr Kamoda Prosad Saha, a professor of Forensic Department of the hospital, told a select group of journalists.



The first autopsy report was made public on Monday after 15 days of the brutal murder of the girl at Comilla Mainamati Cantonment.



Meanwhile, a fresh post-mortem, in compliance with a court order, was conducted on Tonu’s body after exhuming it in Muradnagar upazila here on

Wednesday. However, the report of this second autopsy is still awaited.



Dr Prosad conducted the second autopsy along with Dr Omar Faruk and Sharmin Sultana of the hospital.



Sohagi Jahan Tonu, 19, a second year history student of Comilla Victoria College and a member of Victoria College Theatre, went missing on March 20, hours after she had gone out of her house at Comilla Mainamati Cantonment for private tuition.



Later, Tonu’s father, Yar Hossain, found his daughter lying senseless with severe injuries in her body in a bush adjacent to their house.



She was then whisked off to Combined Military Hospital where doctors declared her dead.



The killing of the girl in the cantonment area sparked off strong protests across the country.
