Cop sent to jail on bribery charge
A Bagerhat court on Monday sent a sub-inspector of police to jail on charge of receiving bribe from a hotel owner in 2010.

The accused is Mosharraf Hossain, a former sub-inspector of Bagerhat Model Police Station who is now posted at Gopalganj. He is the son of Abul Hossain of Mahishdia village in Dighalia upazila of Khulna.

Judge M Mohiduzzaman of Bagerhat Special Tribunal passed the order when the accused appeared before the court seeking bail.

Court sources said on March 31, 2010, the then sub-inspector of Model PS Mosharraf with two other police constables went to Zayeda Residential Hotel in Ranobijoypur area of Sadar upazila and demanded Tk 1 lakh from hotel owner Zayeda Begum.

Refused, Mosharraf forcibly took Zayeda and another hotel border Hossain Khan to the police station and sent the duo to jail after implicating them in a false case.

As they were freed on bail, Mosharraf took Tk 1 lakh from them to exempt from the case. However, he again demanded money from Zayeda in this regard.

Later, the duo made a complaint against the police officer to the high-ups of the police but to no avail.

Meanwhile, the Special Tribunal in the district asked the Anti Corruption Commission to investigate the allegation against Mosharraf following a complaint filed with it.

However, the ACC did not find the allegation against him to be true.

Afterwards, the court directed the police official to appear before it.

The court on April 14 this year issued a warrant for his arrest for non-compliance of its order.

On surrender before it on Monday, the court sent Mosharraf to jail rejecting his bail plea.
