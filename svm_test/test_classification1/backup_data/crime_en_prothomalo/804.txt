Release order for innocent prisoner
A court ordered to release auto-rickshaw driver Jasim Uddin, who was mistakenly imprisoned by Chittagong police.

Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunal-2 Justice Md Jakir Hossain issued the order at about 12:00pm on Monday.

A report on the issue, titled "Imprisonment for police mistake" was published in the daily Prothom Alo on Monday.

Chittagong Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunal-2 prosecution lawyer MA Naser told Prothom Alo Jasim was jailed as he was mistaken with another Jasim.

Later the plaintiff of the case ascertained the mistake.

The jail and court sources said that in September 2013 Parvin Akhter, a resident of Lohagara upazila, filed a dowry case against her husband Jasim Uddin.

Jasim Uddin, son of Abul Hossain, was arrested and sent to jail.

But, plaintiff Parvin Akhter submitted a plea to the court on 2 September saying that the arrestee Jasim Uddin is not the actual accused.
