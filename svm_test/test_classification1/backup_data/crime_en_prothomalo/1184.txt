DMP launches ‘anti-crime special drive’
Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) has launched a special drive against various kinds of crime, including stealing, mugging and robbery, ahead of the Pahela Baishakh.



Deputy commissioner (Media) of DMP Maruf Hossain Sorder said the special operation began in the early hours of Sunday and it will continue till 16 April.



He said the ongoing drive will hunt listed terrorists and Islamic militants so that no one can create any anarchy in important venues where Pahela Baishakh will be celebrated.



The aim of the drive is also to prevent activities of ‘Ogyan party’, ‘ Malam party’ and eve-teasing in the city, he said.



Besides, police remain alert so that no one can produce Vuvuzela for sale on the occasion of Pahela Baishakh, Maruf added.



Sources at the DMP headquarters said the police have started block raids at residential hotels, messes and slums to arrest the criminals alongside collecting secret information about the offenders.
