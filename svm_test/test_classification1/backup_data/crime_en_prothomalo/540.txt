US officials ask BNP team to explain fake statement
A team of BNP leaders in the Unites States faced 'embarrassing' questions from the officials of the US Congress and the state department over the fake statement.

The BNP delegation went to meet the officials to submit a 48-page memorandum seeking America's good offices mission to resolve current political crisis in Bangladesh.

The team was comprised of Sharafat Hossain Babu, Jasim Uddin Bhuiyan, Golam Faruk Shahin and some other BNP leaders.

Jasim Bhuiyan admitted to Prothom Alo that they had to face some questions from the US officials over the matter of fake statement.

"They raised a variety of questions regarding the issue of signature fraudulence," he said.

In reply, he added, the BNP leaders informed the US officials that they condemned the act of cheating, and said the ruling party agents might be behind such acts of sabotage to damage the image of BNP.

The party has taken action against them. Two leaders were suspended from the US BNP in connection with the forgery.

A fake statement on the country's political situation, using the name of US congressmen, was circulated to the media recently.

President of a faction of the BNP in New York, Habibur Rahman Selim, said, "The signature fraudulence not only left damaging effects on the BNP, but also shattered the image of the expatriate Bangladeshis."
