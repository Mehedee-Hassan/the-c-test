Doubt about Shamarukh's 2nd autopsy report
Nurul Islam, father of doctor Shamarukh Mahzabin, on Sunday expressed his doubts over authenticity of his daughter's second autopsy report at a press conference at Jessore Press Club.

The first autopsy report referred that Shamarukh committed suicide but Shamarukh's father rejected the report, saying that there was massive bribery for distorting the autopsy report.

Shamarukh's father-in-law, former parliamentarian Khan Tipu Sultan and his wife brought the report in their favour using their clout, Nurul added.

Nurul said he met prime minister sheikh Hasina and appealed for justice in his daughter's killing case.

Prime minister assured me of authentic investigation and justice in the case, he added.

On 25 November, Shamarukh's father appealed in a Dhaka court challenging the previous report. After the appeal hearing, Dhaka Metropolitan magistrate, Bikash Kumar Saha, passed an order to exhume the body for second autopsy
