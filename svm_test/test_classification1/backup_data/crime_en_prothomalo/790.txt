Military assault in Sylhet to end anytime: Minister
Home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal on Monday said the military commandos could wrap up their ongoing assault in Sylhet any time neutrilising the militants inside.



"We expect the operation to end anytime, defeating the militants there," he told a media briefing at his office as the security siege continued for the fourth day.



He added that the military para- commandos leading the assault were "proceeding slowly to minimise casualties" at the scene while police was extending them required assistance.

Khan's comments came as commandos shot two militants inside the five-storey building as they attacked the troops while the extremists confirmed their own deaths detonating suicide vests.

"More militants were suspected to be inside . . . but all of them would be neutralized," he said. Fellow extremists from outside, visibly being mixed up with onlookers, launched a retaliatory attack killing six people, two being police officers near the building as the commandos prepared for their final assault on Saturday evening.

Two subsequent militant blasts also wounded nearly 50 people including two military officers serving the elite ant-crime Rapid Action Battalion (RAB).



"The alertness of our law enforcement agencies made it possible to track down the militant hideout there," Khan said.



He said based on their intelligence, tracked down the den and then cordoned the house off while authorities subsequently called out the commandos to launch the assault led by a major general.

On 25 March the Army commandos launched the crackdown after two days of security siege to the building, enforced by police's SWAT, counter terrorism unit and elite ant-crime Rapid Action Battalion (RAB).
