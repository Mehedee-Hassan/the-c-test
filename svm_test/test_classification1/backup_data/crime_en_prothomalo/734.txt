AL men’s bid to seize Mushtaq’s house thwarted
The police on Sunday stopped local Awami League men from laying a seize to Dashpara house of Khandaker Mushtaq Ahmad in Daudkandi upazila, who became president after the assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

The leaders and activists of the upazila unit AL brought a procession from Shahidnagar area towards Mushtaq's house in Dashpara village, Daudkandi, in the morning.

When the procession reached Shahidnagar-Juranpur road in Bagulpur area, the police obstructed them with a sand-laden truck. Later, the ruling party men staged a sit-in there.

Speaking on the occasion, Daudkandi upazila parishad chairman Mohammad Ali Sumon said people will one day pull down the house of Khandaker Mushtaq to free the district from a stigma.

Mizanur Rahman, officer-in-charge of Daudkandi Model Police Station, said they are on alert to avert any unpleasant incident.
