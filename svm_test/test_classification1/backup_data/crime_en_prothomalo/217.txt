Hearing of charges against 130 BNP leaders 26 Nov
A Dhaka court on Sunday fixed 26 November for a hearing in a case filed against 130 BNP leaders and workers, including its joint secretary general, Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, and leader, Amanullah Aman.

Dhaka Additional Metropolitan Court Magistrate, Hakim Ali Masud Sheikh, set the new date taking the defence’s need for time into consideration.

Earlier, Sunday was fixed for the hearing of the case filed with Paltan police station.

However, BNP leaders Ruhul Kabir Rizvi and Amanullah Aman were not produced in court on Sunday as defence council Sanaullah Miah filed the time petition.

Earlier, on 12 March, 2013, sub-inspector Alauddin of Paltan police station filed the case on charges of vandalism and arson attacks near BNP’s Naya Paltan central office.
