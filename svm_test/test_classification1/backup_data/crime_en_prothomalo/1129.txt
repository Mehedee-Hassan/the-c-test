Toki murder: Govt's 'inaction' lamented
Speakers at a roundtable discussion on Friday lamented the government's 'inaction' to ensure justice for the killing of Narayanganj schoolboy Tanvir Mahmud Toki.

They made the remarks while addressing the discussion titled, 'Toki Murder: State's role in trial process is the main obstacle to good governance and democracy', at the National Press Club organised by Santras Nirmul Toki Manch.

Speaking on the occasion, economist MM Akash described the murder of Toki as a well-planned one, and deplored that despite all the evidence are there, the government is doing nothing for ensuring justice.

Bangladesh Udichi Shilpi Gosthi president Kamal Lohani said even though the prime minister promised the trial for Toki murder, nothing has so far been done in this regard even after one and a half years of the incident. "So, it's now proved that her words have no value."

Eminent historian Syed Anwar Hossain observed that the prime minister should work for all of the country's 16 crore people, not for just a single family.

"If the state leaders can't ensure justice for the murder of Sagar-Runi or Toki, the history will never forgive them," Anwar Hossain added.

Presiding over the roundtable meeting, Toki's father Rafiur Rabbi, also Toki Manch convener, said their movement is not only for ensuring justice for Toki murder, but for all the killings.

Toki went missing on March 6, 2013, and his body was recovered from the Shitalakhya River on March 8, 2013.

Economist Anu Muhammad, Serajul Islam, politician Ajoy Roy and Shafi Uddin Ahmed also spoke on the occasion.
