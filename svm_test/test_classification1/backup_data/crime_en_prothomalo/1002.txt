Woman held while stealing child from DMCH
Members of Ansar on Friday detained a woman while stealing a one-and-a-half years old baby girl from the burn unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital.

The incident took place around 3:00 in the afternoon, said DMCH police outpost in-charge inspector Mozammel Haque.



The woman, identified as Popy Akter, 20, has been handed over to Shahbagh police station, he added.



Rehana, mother of the girl, told newsmen that she has been accompanying her husband as he was electrocuted around six months ago. She came to know Popy on Thursday night at the burn unit.



“Popy came to the burn unit again today and I went to the washroom keeping my child to her. Returning to the hospital ward, I found none on the floor,” Rehana added.



When Popy was seen rushing towards the gate of the burn unit, on-duty Ansar members stopped her and detained with the child.





However, Popy claimed that she is not a thief, and was going for a walk.
