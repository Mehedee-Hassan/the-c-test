The Bangladesh Bank has ordered the concerned authorities of all commercial banks to install Anti-Skimming and PIN Shield devices in all of their ATM booths to prevent forgery.

In a directive on Sunday, the central bank said setting up of these devices in all Automated Teller Machine (ATM) booths is compulsory.

Bangladesh Bank said every new ATM booths must install such devices from the day one and the existing booths will have to install the device within next one month.

The central bank issued these instructions in the wake of cash being withdrawn from different ATM booths through forgery.

Recently, such incidents of withdrawing cash from four ATM booths of three private banks took place with the use of skimming devices in the booths.

The skimming device can steal information of the customer’s credit and debit cards.

Bangladesh Bank executive director and spokesperson Shuvankar Saha told the Prothom Alo that the skimming device was installed in four booths of three private banks-Eastern Bank, City Bank and United Commercial Bank (UCB).

The UCB filed a case with Banani police station in connection with stealing information of customer cards using the skimming device.
