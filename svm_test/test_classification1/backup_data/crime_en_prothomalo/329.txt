Bangladesh accounts for 4pc global terrorist attacks
Four per cent of the global terrorist attacks took place in Bangladesh in 2015, reveals a global report on the trends of terrorism.

The Global Terrorism Index-2016, published on Wednesday, has placed Bangladesh at 22nd position among 130 nations.

In 2015, 23 countries registered their highest number of deaths from terrorism on record, according to the index report produced by Sydney-based Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP).

A total of 29,376 people lost lives in terrorist attacks worldwide in 2015, a year which, though, saw a 10 per cent decline in such deaths.

In South Asia, a hotspot of global terrorism, Afghanistan, placed at the 2nd position, accounted for 14 per cent of such attacks in 2015. Eight per cent of terrorist attacks took place in Pakistan at 4th place and 7 per cent in India at the 8th position in the list.

“2015 was also a difficult year for Bangladesh, resulting in the most attacks and deaths... There were 459 attacks which resulted in 75 deaths,” observed the report.

However, according to Bangladesh media reports, in as many as 28 incidents of terrorist attacks in the country in 2015, 30 people lost lives.

Historically, the index report pointed out, terrorism in Bangladesh has been carried out by local groups such as Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen, a group which was allegedly involved in the July 2016 Holey Artisan Bakery attack in Dhaka that resulted in 29 deaths altogether.

“However, for the first time al-Qa’ida in the Indian Subcontinent and a local ISIL affiliate engaged in attacks, resulting in 11 deaths in 2015,” the report added.

It also mentioned that the newest al-Qa’ida affiliate, al-Qa’ida in the Indian Subcontinent, began activities in September 2014 and claimed responsibility for the deaths of secular bloggers and publishers in Bangladesh.

Iraq topped the 2016 index and Nigeria ranked 3rd, Syria at 5th and Yemen at 6th position in the index.

The report said the 10 per cent fall in global deaths from terrorism in 2015 was overshadowed by a rise in the overall impact of terrorism as more countries register record terrorist levels.

The global economic impact of terrorism amounted to $89.6 billion in 2015, said the report.

The yearly report, developed by the IEP based on the global terrorism database by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) as well as other sources, provides the most comprehensive resource on global terrorist trends.
