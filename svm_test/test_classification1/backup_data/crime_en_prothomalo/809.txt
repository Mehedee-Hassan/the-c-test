3 siblings sentenced to death
A Noakhali court on Tuesday sentenced three siblings to death for murdering a housewife in 2005.

The court concluded that convict Ibrahim Khalil, along with his younger brother Abdullah Mia and sister Anwara Begum, tortured his wife, Ayesha Khatun, to death for dowry on 26 May 2005.

They later dumped the body at a paddy field near their house at the village of South Kacchapia at Subarnachar in Noakhali.

Later, police recovered the body after victim's mother Sakina Khatun filed a murder case accusing the three persons.

Police arrested the accused, but Abdullah and Anwara went into hiding after getting bail from a court in December 2005. They are still absconders.

After examining records and witnesses, Noakhali Women and Child Repression Prevention Tribunal judge Sayeed Ahmed gave verdict.
