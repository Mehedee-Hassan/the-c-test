ACC quizzes 5 Janata Bank officials
The Anti-Corruption Commission on Thursday questioned five former officials of Janata Bank in connection with the embezzlement of about Tk 1300 crore by Ananda Shipyard, a manufacturer and exporter of ships.

An ACC team, led by its deputy director Zainul Abedin Shebly, interrogated the bank officials on Thursday morning at the anti-graft body's headquarters.

The officials are former first assistant general managers (AGM) Shamsunnahar Begum and Mohammad Enamul Haque, former AGM Mohammad Afzal Hossain, former deputy general manager (DGM) Mohammad Nazrul Islam and former general manager (GM) Mohammad Nuruzzaman.

Six more officials will be questioned on 8 February. They are former first assistant general managers Mohammad Mushfikur Rahman and MA Matin, former assistant executive officer Israfil Shikdar, former manager Mohammad Mahfuzur Rahman, former AGM Purnendu kumar Ray and former AGM Sagar Ahmed.

ACC sources said these officials were directly or indirectly responsible for sanctioning loans worth over Tk 238 crore to Ananda Shipyard.

Ananda Shipyard has embezzled over Tk 1300 crore from 14 different banks in the name of ship export.

Although Ananda Shipyard did not have prior experience of ship export or enough collateral, such big loans were granted. After Bangladesh Bank found irregularities in its inspections, the incident of embezzlement came to the fore, the sources said.

The ACC started the investigation in April last year.
