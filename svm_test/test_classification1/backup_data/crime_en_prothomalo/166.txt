A Gaibandha court here on Tuesday granted interim bail until 8 December to Manjurul Islam Liton, Awami League MP from Gaibandha-1 constituency, in a case filed for shooting a minor boy, reports news agency UNB.

Senior Judicial Magistrate Maniruzzaman Shikdar passed the order when MP Liton appeared before the court on the prorogation of 8th parliamentary session, with a bial petition.

After hearing, the court granted bail to the ruling party MP till the next hearing of the case scheduled for 8 December.

Earlier on 8 November, a trial court granted interim bail to the Awami League MP until the prorogation of the parliamentary session that ended on Monday.

Detectives arrested MP Liton from the Uttara area in the capital on 14 October.

The arrest had come hours after the Supreme Court (SC) stayed a High Court order directing the ruling party MP to surrender before a lower court by 18 October in the case.

On 2 October, minor boy Sourav, 8, son of Sazu Miah of Gopalcharan village, suffered wounds to his both legs with bullets allegedly fired by Manjurul Islam Liton at the village in Sundarganj upazila.

Sazu filed an attempted murder case against Liton the following day.
