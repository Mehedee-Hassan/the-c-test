Mirza Abbas denied bail
The High Court has rejected the bail prayer of BNP standing committee member Mirza Abbas in two cases filed for his alleged involvement in subversive activities.



The HC bench of Justice Md Ruhul Quddus passed the rejection orders on Monday.



The bench fixed Monday to pass the orders after it had held the hearing of Mirza Abbas' anticipatory bail petitions in the two cases on Sunday.



The cases were filed with Paltan and Motijheel police stations against the BNP leader on charges of vandalism and setting fire to vehicles.
