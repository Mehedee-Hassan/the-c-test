Khaleda vows to oust govt after Eid
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) will launch its movement to overthrow the government after the forthcoming Eid, said the party chairperson Khaleda Zia on Tuesday.

She asked the government to hold discussions without any delay to ensure free and fair elections.

She was addressing an iftar party organised by Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), one of the partners of the BNP-led 20-Party Alliance, at Ladies Club in Dhaka on Tuesday.

In a brief speech just before the iftar, addressing the government she said, "Don't threaten us with guns. Guns can become atrocious, you may have been punished brutally, you have to atone for your actions in future."

Khaleda Zia said the country has no law and order as it has no legitimate government. Awami League cannot control its activists who are doing looting and oppressing others.

LDP president Oli Ahmed and secretrary general Redwan Ahmed, BNP standing committee member MK Anwar, MA Gani and Nazarul Islam Khan, among others, were present.
