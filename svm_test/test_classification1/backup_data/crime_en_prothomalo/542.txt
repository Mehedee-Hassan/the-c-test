PM's visit to UNGA waste of public money: Fakhrul
Criticising Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for going to the USA with a huge delegation of 180 people, Bangladesh Nationalist Party on Monday said this is an example of whimsical use of state power by the current illegal government.

“We think it's a complete wastage of taxpayers' money. We also think this an example of how the current illegal regime is capriciously using the state power," said BNP acting secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir.

Addressing a press briefing at BNP’s Nayapaltan central office, he also claimed there is no justification of going to the USA by the Prime Minister of the current government, formed without people’s mandate through a farcical election, for attending the 69th UN General Assembly (UNGA) by spending huge money from the national exchequer.

“We condemn such wastage of public money without any justification,” the BNP leader added.

The press briefing was arranged to inform reporters about the nationwide daylong hartal enforced by the BNP-led the 20-party alliance demanding cancellation of the 16th amendment to the constitution.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka for New York Sunday night to attend the 69th UN General Assembly (UNGA) which Bangladesh considers as an opportunity to embolden its image at the global stage.

Fakhrul said no Prime Minister of the country had joined the UNGA with such a big entourage in the past.

The BNP spokesman said the Prime Minister has included nine ministers with their wives and her many relatives in her entourage only to waste public money.

He criticised Hasina for taking with her to the UNGA a secretary who is accused of obtaining a fake freedom fighter’s certificate through forgery.
