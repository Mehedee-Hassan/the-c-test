EU condemns RU teacher killing
European Union (EU) ambassador to Bangladesh, Pierre Mayaudon has strongly condemned the killing of Rajshahi University English department professor AFM Rezaul Karim Siddique on 23 April.



Mayaudon in a statement issued on Sunday said, “Killings of academics and intellectuals are irreparable losses for any society as a whole.”



The statement further said the initial findings indicate that the crime was conducted by fanatics. “Should it be confirmed, this would be yet another terror attack in Bangladesh in a short period of time,” it said.

Ambassador Mayaudon conveyed his condolences to the family of Prof Rezaul and hoped that thorough investigation would bring the instigators and perpetrators of this crime to justice.
