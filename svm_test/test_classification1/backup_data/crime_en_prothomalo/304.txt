Zero tolerance to terrorism: Mizanur
National Human Rights Commission chairman Mizanur Rahman on Sunday said the present scenario of the country is really a point of concern.



The government's priority is to provide security to the life and property of the countrymen. So, terrorism would not be tolerated in the name of political movement, he said.



He was speaking at a discussion titled 'Human rights under threat: Our role' at the BRAC Centre Inn at Mohakhali in the city.



Human rights activists from France, the Netherlands and also from other embassies as well as European Union and delegates from different organisations spoke on the present condition of the country and the role of NHRC at the discussion.

Mizanur Rahman said the state and the law enforcement agencies can use full strength to stop terrorism in the country, but they have to be careful about not depriving anyone of the basic human rights.

The law enforcement agencies, in some cases, are using power in excess, he admitted.

Former adviser to a caretaker government Rasheda K Chowdhury, Maj Gen (retd) Abdur Rashid, Law Commission member Shah Alam and former vice-chancellor of Jahangirnagar University Anwar Hossain also spoke on the occasion.
