Police aims to prevent rawhide smuggling
Dhaka Metropolitan Police has decided not to allow any rawhide-carrying vehicle to leave Dhaka for three days following Eid-ul-Azha to prevent rawhide smuggling to neighbouring countries, said DMP commissioner Benazir Ahmed on Sunday.

Addressing a press conference on security measures ahead of Durga Puja and Eid-ul-Azha, the DMP commissioner also said extensive security measures were taken to tackle the security challenge ahead of Durga Puja and Eid festivals.

Eid-ul-Azha, the second largest religious festival of Muslims, will be celebrated on October 6, when millions of animals are usually sacrificed across the country, generating huge rawhides. And many hides are smuggled out of the country.

The DMP Commissioner said police forces will be deployed at 219 Puja Mandaps set up in the capital from September 29, the DMP commissioner told the press conference held at DMP Media Centre on the city’s Minto Road.

Police will keep sharp vigil on city roads as well as set up check points at important spots to ensure the security during the Eid and Puja celebrations.

They will also look after the security of the huge cattle-carrying trucks expected to enter the city ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, said Benazir.

Police forces will remain deployed round the clock at 22 cattle markets — 21 temporary and 1 permanent ones — across the city, he added.
