178 BFIDC appointments postponed
The appointment of 178 officers and employees at the Bangladesh Forest Industries Development Corporation has been postponed over allegations of violating quota, irregularity and bribery.

A committee, headed by additional secretary of the ministry Rafiqul Islam, has been formed to investigate into the allegations and take measures against the people liable for the anomalies.

Forest and environment minister Anwar Hossain Manju said the appointment process has been suspended and the allegations are being examined.

It is alleged that no quota system was followed in the recruitment process. Recruitment tests were taken with same type of questions for varying categories of posts.

It was also alleged that those who scored 22, bellow the pass mark of 28 out of the total marks of 70 in written test, were also recruited.

Some candidates with ages over the age-limit, stipulated in the recruitment conditions, were selected for appointment.

The master-roll workers were supposed to get privilege in the recruitment. But none of them was recruited.

It is alleged that bribery caused the anomalies in the recruitment process.

The corporation insiders revealed that BFIDC chairman Prashanta Bhushan Barua called the members of the recruitment committee to his house and accomplished the recruitment process there, not at office.

The BFIDC chairman did not receive phone call as the correspondent tried to reach him to verify the allegations.

Recruitment committee member secretary Meer Ali Reza, however, denied the allegations.
