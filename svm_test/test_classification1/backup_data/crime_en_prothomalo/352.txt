Members of Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) in a drive arrested 12 people along with 3 lakh Yaba tablets from the Bay of Bengal in Teknaf upazila on Tuesday afternoon.

Tipped off, a team of Rab-7 launched a drive in the south of St. Martin’s Island around 5:30pm and recovered the contraband tablets from a fishing boat, assistant police super Sohel Mahmud of Rab-7 told UNB.
