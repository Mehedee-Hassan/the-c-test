‘Govt takes strict measures to stop child repression'
Information minister Hasanul Haq Inu on Friday said the government will show no leniency to anyone over child repression.

He came up with the remarks while talking to reporters after attending a seminar in Bheramara upazila in Kushtia marking the Breast Feeding Week.

Inu, also the president of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD), said the government and the administration are worried about the recent spate of child repression. “The government has taken strict measures to stop repression on children,” he added.

When asked about the possibility of mid-term election, the information minister said there is no political necessity right now to arrange snap polls. “The election will be held as per the constitution.”
