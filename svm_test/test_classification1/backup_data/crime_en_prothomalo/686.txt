"Movement to be announced when high time"
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Khaleda Zia on Monday said the programmes of BNP’s movement will be announced when it is high time.

“The time is looming near. Fixing a date doesn’t make any movement. We are in the movement and will be. I will call for the movement when it is high time. People of the country will join with us then. This government must leave,” she said while addressing a Eid reception hosted by her at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre.

The country is not safe in the hands of this ‘illegal’ government and they are destroying this country, she noted.

The BNP chairperson urged all the people to come forward and work together to save the county from the ‘oppressive and corrupt government’.

People want to see changes in this situation and expect something better, she added.

Khaleda Zia exchanged Eid greetings and pleasantries with Ambassadors, High Commissioners, Charge d' Affaires of different countries and representatives of different donor agencies.

Khaleda also exchanged greetings with leaders and activists of BNP and its affiliates, senior journalists, cultural personalities, representatives of the business community and professionals.

BNP standing committee members and senior leaders were also present on the occasion.
