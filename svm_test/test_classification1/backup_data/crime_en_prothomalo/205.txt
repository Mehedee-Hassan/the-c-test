Tk 10/kg rice scheme an arrangement of looting, Khaleda tweets
BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has blasted the ruling Bangladesh Awami League's 'affluent people for looting the rice' allocated for distribution among the poor at Tk 10 a kilogram.



In a twitter post on Thursday, the former prime minister alleged that the AL government that came to power without mandate has made the arrangement for plundering the public resources.



“We are ashamed and stunned at the news of looting rice meant for sales at Tk 10 a kg for the poor by affluent people of Bangladesh Awami League (AL) across the country,” read Khaleda's twitter post.



The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson tweeted the post around 4:00pm with a placard that contained allegations of looting of rice at Tk 10 a kg.



In the placard, Khaleda also gave a brief description of the initiatives taken by her government for providing the poor with rice at a subsidised rates.



“We kept the price of coarse rice below Tk 14-15 until 2007. We introduced open market sales (OMS) system for providing the poor with rice at a curtailed rate, apart from giving them the rice free, when the rice price went up or when there was scarcity,” Khaleda recalled.



She said any poor people could buy five-kg rice at a time during her tenure.



“But, now the rice is distributed only among the cardholders which are given to the ruling party’s affluent people, leading to the looting. The poor are being deprived.”



Condemning the ‘loot’, the BNP leader alleged that the government which, she said, came to power without voting has made “an arrangement of loot, snatching away the food of the poor.”
