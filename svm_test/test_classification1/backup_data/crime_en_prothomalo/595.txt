Sylhet transport workers postpone strike
Sylhet transport owners and workers association on Saturday postponed their strike until 15 April hours after enforcing an indefinite transport strike in the district demanding the arrest of the killers of a driver.

The decision came after a meeting between Sylhet city corporation mayor Ariful Haque Chowdhury and transport leaders and workers in the city corporation office in the afternoon.

City mayor Ariful Haque said they postponed the strike considering the sufferings of Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examinees.

Earlier in the morning, long-distance buses or trucks on different roads of the district came to a complete halt as the transport workers went on the strike demanding the arrest of the killers of a driver and attackers of another.

The transport workers staged sit-ins at all the entrances to the district about 8:00am supporting strike. Two vehicles were vandalised at Humayun Rashid Chattar in the city.

Miscreants swooped on an auto-rickshaw driver, Shafique Miah, at Lalabazar in the Dakkhin Surma upazila over a previous feud in the morning, leaving him injured.

The injured driver was admitted to Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College and Hospital.

Miscreants on Tuesday at Dhopagul on the outskirts of the city chopped a pickup driver to death.

The transport workers blocked Sylhet-Dhaka Highway at Lalabazar for two hours on Friday protesting the attack on the CNG-run auto-rickshaw driver.

Outraged by the incident, the auto-rickshaw drivers staged demonstrations and blocked on the Dhaka-Sylhet Highway at Lalabazar, causing a long tailback of vehicles on both sides of the busy highway.
