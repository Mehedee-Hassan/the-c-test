Pak ‘diplomat’ withdrawn from Dhaka
Mohammad Mazhar Khan, who was posted as an assistant visa officer to the Pakistan High Commission in Dhaka, has left Bangladesh following allegations of terror financing and currency forgery.

The high commission informed the foreign affairs ministry on Sunday that he was withdrawn and he left Dhaka with his family members on Saturday evening.

Dhaka contacted Islamabad to inform the activities of Mazhar after intelligence reported that he was involved in militancy funding and currency forgery.

The government of Bangladesh also asked the Pakistan High Commission to withdraw Mazhar Khan, who was alleged to be an agent of his country’s secret service.

Asked if he was expelled from Bangladesh, a foreign ministry official told Prothom Alo that since he was not a member of the diplomatic team in the high commission, such step was not relevant in his case.

Mazhar Khan was arrested with a Bangladeshi in the city’s Banani area last month. But the high commission arranged his release from police custody under certain privileges that a diplomat is entitled to.
