Cycle bomb retrieved in Dhaka


The Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) on Sunday retrieved a 'cycle bomb' from a house in the Kaltabazar area in the capital city.

The elite force also retrieved 58 crude bombs, 48 petrol bombs, 500 grams of sulphur powder, pipe bombs and huge stones from the place.

The RAB has detained two people Aminul Islam alias Rana, 30, and Riazul Islam, 22, in this connection from the house at Kaltabazar.

The RAB-2 office at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar said this in a press conference.

The RAB said the cycle's hollow frame was full of explosives. It has been transformed into a mobile bomb, the elite force said.

Mufti Mahmud Khan, director of the law and media wing of the RAB, said they retrieved the cycle bomb based on the information given by Rakib Shashy, earlier arrested from the Kakrail area of the city.

During interogation, the detainees said that they were involved with Titumir College Chhatra Dal, a pro-BNP students wing, and they are associates of Anisur Rahman alias Khokon, former organising secretary of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD).

They hurled petrol bombs in the buses, torched vehicles and created violence at the direction of the JCD leader, they said.

Masud Rana, director of RAB-2, told Prothom Alo that usually a petrol bomb contains 20-30 grams of explosives. But, the cycle bomb had at least 1 kilogram to 1.5 kilograms of explosives, he added.

Ziaul Ahsan, assistant director general of RAB, said a man named Liton supplied the cycle bomb from the Jessore border.

The RAB came to know that the group made few other improvised bombs like this, he said.
