BNP to hold countrywide protests on 20 March


The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) will lay siege to the Deputy Commissioners’ (DCs) offices across the country on Thursday protesting what it said the widespread capturing of polling centres and election fraud by ruling party men during the third phase of upazila elections held on March 15.



The siege programme is also meant for registering the party’s protest against the incidents of forced disappearance and secret killing by the members of government agencies.



The party will also submit memorandums containing demands to the deputy commissioners on the day.



BNP joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi announced the programme at a press briefing at the party’s central office at Naya Paltan in Dhaka on Tuesday.





“The government has resorted to violence in a bid to raise the number of ruling party-backed winning candidates in the third phase of upazila polls. The ruling party activists have indulged in widespread irregularities and vote fraud with the help of administrations in the polls,’’ he said.





The BNP leader further said the ruling party activists are attacking and looting the houses and business establishments of the BNP-backed candidates and their supporters at different parts of the country ahead of the next phase of the upazila polls. “They’re resorting to violence to divert people’s attention to different directions on their misdeeds and vote fraud in the elections.”





Rizvi also alleged that senior BNP leaders, including its acting BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain and Mirza Abbas, have been sent to custody in ‘false’ cases out of fear to face people’s movement.
