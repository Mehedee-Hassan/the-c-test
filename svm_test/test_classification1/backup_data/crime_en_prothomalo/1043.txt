Garo girl rape accused Rubel remanded
The accused in Garo girl rape case, Afsan Rahman Rubel, who fled the police custody Saturday and was arrested again, was put on a six-day remand on Tuesday.

Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Sadbir Yasir Ahsan Chowdhury handed down the order.

“I fled the police custody fearing police torture,” Rubel said when he was produced before the court for remand plea.

Sources in the court said the accused pleaded with the court not to put him on remand.

The 26-year-old youth escaped police custody on Saturday as he was taken to a Dhaka court for recording statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Earlier on Friday the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) arrested Rubel and was later handed over to Badda police station on Saturday.

Police sub-inspector Imranul Hassan and constable Dipok were suspended for negligence of their duties in connection with the escape of the accused.
