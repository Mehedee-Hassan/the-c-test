HC clears way to try Khaleda
Proceedings against the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson, Khaleda Zia, to continue as High Court on Wednesday rejected her plea challenging her indictment in Zia Orphanage Trust and Zia Charitable Trust corruption cases.

HC bench of Justice Borhanuddin and KM Kamrul Quader passed the order after Khaleda Zia lodged two separate revision petitions with the HC on 13 April seeking cancellation of the indictment orders against her and eight others.

Earlier on 19 March, charges against Khaleda, her son Tarique Rahman and seven others were framed by the Dhaka special judge Basudev Roy in response to the cases filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC).

After the order passed, ACC panel lawyer Khurshid Alam Khan said HC rejected Khaleda Zia's appeal for the cancellation of her indictment and made way for the further proceedings against her.

The two cases, Zia Charitable Trust graft case and Zia Orphanage Trust graft case, were filed by ACC on on 8 August 2011 and 3 July 2009 respectively accusing Khaleda and eight others of embezzlement and misappropriation of money from these two organisations named after former president Ziaur Rahman.
