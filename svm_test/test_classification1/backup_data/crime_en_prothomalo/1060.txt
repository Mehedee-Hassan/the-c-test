ASI held in Cox’s Bazar over cop ‘gang rape’
An assistant sub-inspector of police was arrested from the beach town on Wednesday in connection with the alleged gang-rape of a female police constable in the capital.

The arrestee was identified as Kalimur Rahman, ex-husband of the victim.

Officer-in-charge of Cox's Bazar Sadar police station Motiur Rahman said a team of detectives from Dhaka arrested Kalimur from Kolatoli beach in the morning.

Earlier on Tuesday, doctors at the Forensic Department of Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) in a test found the evidence of rape of the female police constable.

Sources at DMCH’s One Stop Crisis Centre (OCC) told UNB that the evidence of rape of the policewoman has been found in the forensic test and they have already received the test report.

The sources, however, declined to elaborate whether the test found the evidence of 'gang-rape' or only rape by the cop’s ex-husband.

The 24-year-old female police constable of Turag Police Station was gang-raped allegedly by her ex-husband ASI Kalimur Rahman and his five associates in a Khilgaon house in the city on June 11.

On June 13, she lodged a complaint with Khilgaon Police Station in this regard. Later, she was admitted to the DMCH. The victim also underwent the forensic test the following day.

The victim's ex-husband had been on the run since the female constable lodged the complaint with the Khilgaon Police Station.
