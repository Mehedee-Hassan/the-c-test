Bankers behind loan scams moving scot-free
The bankers, accused in the Hall-Mark and Basic Bank loan scams, are allegedly moving scot-free despite there are warrants to arrest them.

The parliament committee on finance ministry expressed its resentment over the police inaction at a meeting at Sangsad Bhaban on Tuesday.

Several thousand crores of taka was embezzled from Sonali Bank in the name of sanctioning loan to Hall-Mark and Basic Bank officials also were involved in misappropriating huge amount of money.

The meeting sources said the committee came to know that the former Sonali Bank managing director Humayun Kabir and Basic Bank chairman Abdul Hey have not yet been arrested.

Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith wanted to know why the bankers were not arrested while they are staying in the country. He said he would contact the home ministry and the Anti Corruption Commission in this regard.

Emerging from the meeting, the committee chairman Abdur Razzak MP said the committee also decided to write to the authorities concerned to take immediate measures to arrest the bankers.

He further said the investigation into the Basic Bank loan forgery is also at the final stage now, and the probe report would be submitted to the committee shortly.

Presided over by Abdur Razzak, the meeting was also attended by parliament members Abdul Wadud, Farhad Hossain, Mustafizur Rahman Chowdhury and Showkat Chowdhury.

Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman and high officials of the finance ministry were present, beside the minister, in the the meeting.
