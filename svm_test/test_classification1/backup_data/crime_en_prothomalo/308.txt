AL a party of terrorism: BNP
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Friday said the Canadian government never considered the BNP a terrorist organisation.



“No matter what the Canadian court delivers in a verdict on an application of an asylum seeker, it will bring about no political changes in Bangladesh. The BNP has no relations with this verdict,” said Mirza Fakhrul told a views exchange meeting with the party activists in his ancestral district of Thakurgaon.



He alleged that the Bangladesh Awami League (AL) government has resorted to all means of falsehood to cling to the state power.



“The Awami League is ecstatic over the Canadian court verdict. They say the BNP doesn’t have the strength. Then, why do you [AL] want to cancel the registration of the BNP,” said Fakhrul referring to the speeches of a group of AL MPs in parliament where they demanded revocation of the BNP’s registration with the election commission.

“This is only because,” he went on saying, “you know the BNP is the only political party in Bangladesh which upholds the people’s hopes and aspirations.”

He maintained that his party never believes in terrorism.

“If anyone practices terrorism and if anyone teaches terrorism, it is the Awami League.”

Referring to the killing of Gaibandha AL MP Manjurul Islam Liton, the BNP secretary general said the AL started blaming the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami for killing Liton shortly after the killing.

“Now a former MP of Awami League’s ally Jatiya Party has been arrested over the killing. It proves that they and their allies are involved in this terrorism. The Awami League is a party of terrorism. It is the Awami League which has given birth to terrorism,” Fakhrul alleged.
