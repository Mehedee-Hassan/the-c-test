Holey Artisan handed over to owner
Police handed over the Holey Artisan Bakery to the cafe authorities on Sunday, after four and a half months into the militant attack on the restaurant on 1 July, says news agency UNB.

Deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police Masudur Rahman said the Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit formally handed over the restaurant to its owner around 4:15pm following a court order.

The cafe remained closed since 2 July as the special DMP crime unit which is investigating the militant attack took its control.

Armed militants stormed the Holey Artisan Bakery and opened fire and took around 40 local and foreign people hostage on 1 July.

Twenty-two people, including nine Italians, seven Japanese and one Indian, were killed in the terror attack.
