‘IS’ threatens to kill Pirojpur imam
Islamic State, Middle-East-based militant group, has allegedly threatened to kill a mosque imam of Kaukhali upazila in Pirojpur, reports news agency UNB.

The threat was issued to Omar Faruque, imam of Dakkhin Bazar Central Jam-e Mosque in the upazila headquarters, through a letter that was found in the mosque on Friday.

Jahangir Hossain, officer-in-charge of Kaukhali police station, said someone dropped the letter, sent in the name of IS Kaukhali branch, in the mosque in the morning.

The letter reads, “You don’t want Islami caliphate is established in Bangladesh. You are disinclined to discuss jihad. Your killing will be Shariah worthy. Get ready for death. You’ll be slaughtered in your room”.

Meanwhile, security has been beefed up in the mosque following the death threat.

Contacted, the imam told UNB that he would lodge a general diary in this regard on Saturday.
