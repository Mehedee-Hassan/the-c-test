Barisal police commissioner, deputy withdrawn
Barisal Metropolitan Police (BMP) commissioner and deputy commissioner were withdrawn for their alleged involvement in raising bribe fund in exchange for promotion of police personnel.

The accused are commissioner Shoibal Kanti Chowdhury and deputy commissioner Shoyeb Ahmed.

According to a fax sent to BMP on Monday, Shoibal was transferred to police headquarters while Shoyeb to Narayanganj.

A BMP official, on anonymity, said as the directive was issued against senior officials, so, I am not right person to make comment on the issue as a junior. However, the official confirmed the withdrawal order sent by a fax.

Shoibal Kanti said, “I have not got any directive yet. Once the directive is issued, it will be seen on television scroll.”

The Police Headquarters came to know that members of BMP police are collecting money to raise bribe fund for their promotion. Deputy commissioner Zillur Rahman was leading the fund team.

In 2014, more than 400 constables attended promotion examinations. Of them, 232 constables passed the exams.

They could not be appointed due to insufficient vacant posts.

Deputy commissioner Zillur Rahman (now suspended), assured them he will manage it. Zillur Rahman then asked the constables to pay Tk 50,000 each to bribe the higher authorities.

As per the decision, SI Anisuzzaman, Nayek Kabir, and constable Babul opened a joint bank account. Tk 7.7 million were deposited in the account.

Police headquarters started investigation against the accused on 17 June this year.

Later, 10 policemen were suspended, including Zillur Rahman, for their alleged involvement with the bribe fund.

BMP commissioner Shoibal Kanti Chowdhury and deputy commissioner Shoyeb Ahmed were found guilty in the investigation.
