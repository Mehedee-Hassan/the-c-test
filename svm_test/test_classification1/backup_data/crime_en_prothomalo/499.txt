UN chief for investigating allegations of rigging
The UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon has asked the Bangladesh authorities to investigate all allegations of vote fraud and violence during city polls.

His spokesperson reiterated the UN position during a briefing in New York on Friday.

Deputy spokesman Farhan Haq also confirmed the telephone conversation between the UN chief and Bangladesh premier Sheikh Hasina on the day.

The UN is yet to disclose the details of the conversation, however.

The UN secretary-general also reiterated the call on the opposition to use democratic institutions to express their concerns.

The deputy spokesman came up with the response when he was asked if the UN believes whether the Awami League government would fairly investigate the allegations when the ruling party men and the administration were being blamed for electoral violence and fraudulent practice.

After the telephone conversion, prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s press secretary told newsmen that the UN chief was disappointed with the BNP’s boycott of the city polls half way through.
