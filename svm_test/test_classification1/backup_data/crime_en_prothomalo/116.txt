Cabinet approves Child Marriage Restraint Act
The cabinet on Monday approved the final draft of Child Marriage Restraint Act 2014 with increased punishment and fine.

Cabinet secretary Mohammad Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan told Prothom Alo that the punishment for the violation of the law will be a maximum two-years of jail sentence and Tk 50, 000 fine.

The executive magistrate will pass the sentence, but if the marriage is to be annulled, the matter will go to the family court.

According to the existing laws, the punishment for child marriage is maximum three months' jail sentence and Tk 1,000 fine.

Those directly or indirectly involved with child marriage are also punishable under the law.

If the accused is a woman, she will only have to pay fine, not face jail sentence.

Presently women under 18 years and men under 21 are considered under-aged. The cabinet, however, has asked the ministry to review if the present age bracket can be lowered.
