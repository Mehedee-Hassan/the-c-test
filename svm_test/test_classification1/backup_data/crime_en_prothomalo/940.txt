Three people including the district president and secretary of Islami Chhatra Shibir were injured reportedly in a gunfight with police in Panchbibi upazila of Joypurhat early Friday, reports our Jaipurhat correspondent.

The injured are Abujar Gifari, 28, president of Joypurhat Chhatra Shibir, Omar Ali, 22, secretary of the unit and a man named Al-Amin.

Police also arrested a local Jamaat leader, Sujaul Islam.

Locals said the victims had been arrested by the members of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) on Wednesday.

Panchbibi police officer in-charge Ashraful Alam said the associates of the Shibir leaders opened fire on them, when police along with the arrestees went to recover arms, leaving the three men shot in their knees.

The injured were under treatment at Joypurhat district modern hospital.

Meanwhile, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami in a press statement afterwards condemned and protested at the “ill-attempt to kill the Shibir workers.”

“The law enforcers shot the Shibir leaders in a cool head in an attempt to kill them, but fortunately they are still alive even after being seriously wounded,” said Jamaat’s central executive committee member and former MP Hamidur Rahman Azad.

Azad also demanded exemplary punishment of the members of law enforcers involved in such “heinous act.”
