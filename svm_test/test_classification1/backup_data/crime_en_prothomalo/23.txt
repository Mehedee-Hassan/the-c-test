SC stays bail for 2 Destiny bosses until 11 Aug
The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on Sunday stayed until 11 August a High Court order that granted a six-month ad-interim bail to Destiny Group managing director Rafiqul Amin and Destiny-2000 chairman Mohammad Hossain in two money-laundering cases.

A four-member bench of the Appellate Division headed by Chief Justice S K Sinha passed the order.

The SC also asked the ACC to file leave-to-appeal petitions with the court against the HC order that granted the duo bail, said ACC lawyer M Khurshid Alam Khan.

Earlier on 20 July, the HC granted the six-month ad-interim bail to the two Destiny Group and Destiny-2000 high-ups on certain conditions in the two cases filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission.

On 31 July 2012, the anti-graft watchdog filed the two money laundering cases against Destiny-2000 chairman M Hossain and the Destiny Group’s managing director Rafiqul Amin and 20 others on charge of misappropriating investors’ money amounting to Tk 3,285 crore.

ACC deputy director Mozahar Ali Sarder filed one case with Kalabagan Police Station against 12 officials of Destiny-2000, including its chairman and managing director, under the Money Laundering Act 2012 for allegedly misappropriating over Tk 2,106 crore from the Destiny Tree Plantation Limited (DTPL).

ACC assistant director Toufiqul Islam filed the other case with the same police station against 22 Destiny officials under the same act for alleged embezzlement of Tk 1,178 crore from the Destiny Multipurpose Cooperative Society Limited (DMCSL).

On 4 May this year, the ACC submitted charge-sheets before the court in the two cases.

The chairman and the MD of Destiny surrendered before a Dhaka court in connection with the two cases seeking bail on 11 October 2012.
