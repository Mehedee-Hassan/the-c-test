Fakhrul gets HC bail in all cases
The High Court on Sunday granted an interim bail to detained BNP acting secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir in three more violence cases filed with Paltan police station, paving the path for his release from jail.

An HC bench, comprising Justice M Rezaul Haque and Justice M Khasruzzaman, passed the order after hearing separate petitions.

The court also issued a rule asking the government why Fakhrul would not be granted permanent bails in the three cases.

Fakhrul’s lawyer Joynul Abedin said now there is no legal bar to his release from jail.

He said Mirza Fakhrul was granted bail until the rule was disposed of.

Earlier on June 18, the High Court granted Mirza Fakhraul bail in three other violence cases—two were filed with Paltan Police Station while another with Motijheel Police Station.

On April 16, Mirza Fakhrul secured 6 months’ High Court bail in another case filed with Paltan Police Station on January 4 for allegedly carrying out arson and vandalism.

On January 6, plainclothes police picked Fakhrul up as he came out of the Jatiya Press Club following BNP’s announcement to observe January-5 as ‘Democracy Killing Day’. The BNP leader is now facing 79 cases.
