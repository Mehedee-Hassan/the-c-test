Unstoppable Sharifa
Sharifa Khatun was married off right after her SSC exams. In the following years, she had to give up her education to take care of her ailing husband and keep her family afloat.



Like many other women, this could've been the end of the way for Sharifa. But from this very dead end, she paved a way for herself and many others like her.



Today, she is not only a graduate, but also the founder of three schools for underprivileged children, many of whom went on to become graduates.



Sharifa is also working vigorously to stop child marriage and domestic violence.

As recognition of her contribution, Sharifa was honoured with the title Sarbashreshtha Joyeeta (Best of the conquering women) in Rajshahi district in a nationwide programme of the government titled 'Joyeeta Onneshone Bangladesh' (Bangladesh in search of conquering women).

Sharifa and her family reside in the Boro Choyghoti village of Bagha upazila in Rajshahi. Her husband Mohsin Ali is a deed writer by profession. Among their three children, the eldest daughter is an intern at Comilla Medical Hospital after finishing her training as a medical assistant. Their second daughter is a college student while the youngest, a son, is a preschooler.

Sharifa's father, a very poor farmer, married her off right after her SSC exams in 1990. Her husband was unemployed back then, and her in laws were just as poor as her father. Within the daily struggle with poverty, her education was postponed for years. She completed her graduation from Bangladesh Open University 14 years after her marriage.

Sharifa always regretted the lack of opportunities in her life. She noticed, many children of her locality are dropping out of school because of poverty and ending up becoming lowly paid day-labourers.

In 1995, she opened two schools in Boro Choyghoti village and one in Hijalpolli village with the assistance of BRAC. She was well aware of the necessity of adult literacy as well, so she simultaneously started a school for the adults, too.

On 28 February, during a visit to Boro Chayghati village, Sharifa was seen reading a book to the children of the village.

Abdur Razzak, a village watchman who donated his land for Sharifa's school, said although Sharifa does not teach anymore, she is very involved with the school.

Sharifa's days of struggle have not ended yet. Her husband's feet had to be partially amputated due to an inflammatory disease. All of her savings was spent on her husband's treatment.

She sought prime minister Sheikh Hasina's help for her husband's treatment and was given Tk 1 lakh. The donation helped her save the husband's leg, Sharifa said.

During this conversation, several parents of Sharifa's former students came around.

Chameli Khatun, mother of a former student, said her daughter Mita received her primary education from Sharifa. Now she is a graduate with a good job.

Another parent, Mazdar Rahman was about to marry his daughter off when she was just in class eight. Sharifa rushed to the ceremony and stopped that marriage from taking place. Now that girl is an honours student.

Sharifa also became a member of the community police to stop violence against women. She formed 'Swanirvor Nari Kalyan Sangstha' (welfare organization for self-dependent women) with 60 impoverished women of the locality, which works for women issues.

Sharifa has only one aim - she does not want to see anyone facing the obstacles she had to brace in her life.
