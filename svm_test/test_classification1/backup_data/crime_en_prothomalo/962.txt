'Govt indicts Khaleda to kill democracy'
The BNP on Thursday protested framing charges against party chief Khaleda Zia, terming the government move a design to kill the voice of democracy.

The party also demanded an impartial investigation by the United Nations to find out the real culprits of the petrol bomb attacks.

"The government is going ahead with the evil design and is trying to shift the blame of subversive activities to the opposition,” BNP spokesperson Asaduzzaman Ripon told newsmen during a briefing at the party’s Nayapaltan office on Thursday evening.

The day before (Wednesday), Khaleda Zia was indicted as one of 38 accused in the charge-sheet framed by the detectives, for the Jatrabari arson attack on a bus during the BNP-led 20-party’s blockade on 23 January.

“As part of its (the government’s) sinister campaign, the charge-sheet was placed and the three-time prime minister is named as an accused," the BNP leader said.

He said his party does not believe in politics of petrol bomb and torching vehicles.

Asaduzzaman said the government is trying to annihilate the opposition instead of carrying out any credible probe into such incidents.

“We want to call upon the government to shun this destructive path. You won’t be able to strengthen democracy by suppressing dissent,” he added.
