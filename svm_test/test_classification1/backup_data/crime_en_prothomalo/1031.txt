Jamaat declares programme against violence against women
Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami have announced a countrywide “peaceful demonstration” programme for Wednesday, protesting at the sharp rise in incidents of rape and repression against women and children, UNB news agency reports.

Jamaat acting secretary general Shafiqur Rahman declared the programme on Monday while reading out a statement.

“We along with the country’s people are concerned over the recent growing incidents of gang rape and repression against women and children across the country,” he said.

The party alleged that those involved in the incidents are not being arrested and punished due to inaction on part of the government and law enforcement agencies.

“Working women and students of schools and colleges are being subjected to rape. Children are also being abducted, raped and killed. It seems there is no government and law enforcement agency in the country. Parents are passing their days with grave concern,” the Islamist party said.

Referring to different media reports on rape and assault on women, Jamaat, a key component of the BNP-led 20-party alliance, said the ruling party cadres are involved in all the heinous acts.

It alleged that the incidents of violence against women and children are continuously increasing as the law enforcers are not playing active and proper role in containing the crimes. “The law and order situation has gone down to such a level that no one is safe anywhere, even at home.”

The party demanded that the government immediately arrest the ruling party-backed ‘criminals’ involved in such incidents and subject them to exemplary punishment.

Jamaat also urged the country’s people to raise their voice against the sexual harassment of women.

The party also called upon all to observe their countrywide demonstration programme peacefully on Wednesday.
