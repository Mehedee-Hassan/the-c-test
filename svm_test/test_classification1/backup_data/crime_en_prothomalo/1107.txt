Mahmuda murder case investigation officer changed
The investigation officer (IO) of police superintendent Babul Akter’s wife Mahmuda Khanam murder case has been changed.



Assistant commissioner of Detective Branch (DB) Kamruzzaman has now been entrusted with the responsibility. He will take the charge from DB inspector Rakibuddin.



The changes were made following an order of Chittagong Metropolitan Police (CMP) commissioner Iqbal Bahar Chowdhury.



CMP additional deputy commissioner (Public Relations) Anwar Hossain told Prothom Alo that the changes were made to gear up the investigation into the case.



The wife of police SP, Mahmuda Khanam, was hacked and then shot to death by three bikers near GEC crossing in Chittagong when she was going to drop her son for the school bus on 6 June morning.



Later on the day, police super Babul Akhter filed a murder case in this connection accusing three unnamed people.



Police said the murder was an act of revenge against SP Babul Akhter who had a prominent role in curbing militants.



The police claimed on Saturday that they have arrested Sahjahan alias Robin, the suspected mastermind of the killing.
