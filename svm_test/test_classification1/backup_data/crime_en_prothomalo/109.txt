Body of child found in abandoned suitcase
Police recovered a body of a child from inside a suitcase in front of the Dhaka Nursing College in the city early Wednesday.

The victim was seven-eight years old.

Shahbagh police sub-inspector (SI) Md Moinul said the body of a 7-8 year old boy was found in an abandoned suitcase. He wore a three-quarter pant. Marks of torture were found on his body, the SI added.

Police assume that the boy might be a domestic help, and his employer possibly left the body of the boy after he was killed.

Dhaka Medical College Hospital police in-charge Mozammel Haque confirmed the incident.
