Police cannot belong to any party: Dr Kamal
Gono Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain on Saturday said police cannot belong to any political party.

He also said police and administration have become sick these days.

He was speaking at the extended meeting of the central committee of Gono Forum at the party’s central office in the city’s Arambagh area on Tuesday.

‘Police cannot be used for political purpose. They do not belong to any political party. You need to spread this message from village to village,” said Kamal Hossain.

Referring to the corruption of police, he said, “They are our countrymen, not our enemy. Why are they corrupt? It is a desease. They must be cured”

“Police is required to maintain law and order, but all we need is to heal them from the grip of their misdeed,” he added.
