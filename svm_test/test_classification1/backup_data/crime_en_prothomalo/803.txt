Speaker urges MPs to stop violence against women
Speaker Sangsad Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury on Tuesday said lawmakers can play an important role to stop violence against women by formulating necessary laws and ensure its implementation.

Speaking at the 131st Inter Parliamentary Union General Assembly in Geneva on Monday, she said women are inseparable part of development so that women should play an active role in kinds of development works, according to a message received here today.

"Rights of women should be ensured in every development policy and representation of political parties in every country," Shirin Sharmin observed.

She said security and empowerment of women should be included in all development plans in future.

Referring to some examples undertaken in Bangladesh to stop violence against women, the JS speaker said necessary laws should be mandatory to stop all types of violence against women, dowry and early marriages.
