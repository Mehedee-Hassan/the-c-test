Immediate action for abuse of domestic help: Minister
The central monitoring cell, formed to ensure the security of domestic workers, will take immediate action if any allegation is made of torturing domestic help, said state minister for labour and employment, Mujibul Haque, on Thursday.

The state minister made the announcement talking to reporters after a meeting with members of the cell at the Secretariat, reports UNB news agency.

One who employs domestic help must abide by the rules and regulations of the Domestic Workers Protection and Welfare Policy 2015, Mujibul Haque added.

According to the policy, a formal deal has to be signed between the employer and the domestic worker which will ensure minimum wage, working hours, accommodation, casual and maternity leave, contract of employment, entertainment, healthcare support and accident compensation for workers, he said.

Mujibul Haque also said children under the age of 12 cannot be employed as domestic workers.

If any allegation is made about employing under-age children as domestic workers, the monitoring cell will carry out a drive and take action against the employer concerned, he added.

There are at least 1.7 million child workers in the country at present, according to the information of Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS).

The junior minister said his ministry has been working to stop children being employed in risky jobs by 2021.

He also said the central monitoring cell was formed on 13 July 2016, aiming to implement the Domestic Workers Protection and Welfare Policy 2015.

The 22-member cell was formed with Mujibul Haque as its chairman and the secretary of the labour and employment ministry as vice-chairman.

The rest of the 20 members of the cell are owners, workers, and civil society members.
