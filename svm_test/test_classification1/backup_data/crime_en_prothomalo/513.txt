ACC summons One Bank officials over Ananda loan fraud
The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) will interrogate 11 officials of One Bank Limited in connection with a Tk-1,300-crore loan fraud case against Ananda Shipyard.

The anti-graft body has summoned the bank officials to the commission on 2 and 3 February.

ACC deputy director Zainul Abedin Shibly sent a letter to the bank's managing director on Monday, asking them to be present at the commission office at the scheduled dates.

Accordingly, deputy managing director Zohra Bibi, senior executive vice presidents Rozina Alia Ahmed and Mohammad Aftab Uddin, vice president Mohammad Abu Saleh and principal officer Zamil Hossain will be questioned on 2 February.

On 2 February, the ACC officials will interrogate senior vice president Asif Mahmood Khan, senior principal officer Mahbub Hasan, principal officer Mohammad Anisuzzaman and Khaled al Fesani, Motijheel branch-in-charge Mustaba M Kazmi and officer Abu Sahadat Mohammad Shahed.



The ACC said these officials were directly or indirectly involved in issuing loan amounting to Tk 114.21 crore to Ananda Shipyard, a builder and exporter of ships, from One Bank Motijheel branch.

In April 2014, the ACC initiated a probe into the allegations of swindling of Tk 1,300 crore from 14 commercial banks and financial institutions by Ananda Shipyard.

The banks disbursed the loans without collateral, in violation of banking rules as Ananda Shipyard had no experience of building ships at that time. A Bangladesh Bank special inspection found out the violation of rules.
