'Land offices abode of corruption'
Land offices are abode of corruption, and corruption cannot be stopped in the sector despite repeated attempts.

State minister for land Saifuzzaman Chowdhury came up with the observation at a seminar on 'Institutional and Social Barriers for Women and Marginalised Communities to Access Land and Property Rights' at the BRAC Centre in Dhaka on Monday.

Human Rights and Legal Assistance Programme organised the seminar.

The minister considers digitalisation of the administration as the only remedy for the syndrome.

Corruption would not reduce as long as personal contact between the government officials and service receivers is not minimised, the minister said.

About the demand for equal rights of women in inherited property, the minister said, "Islamic guideline on inheritance of property is logical enough."

He advised the organisations like BRAC to conduct awareness programmes at the district and upazila levels.
