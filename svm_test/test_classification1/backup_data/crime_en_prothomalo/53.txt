ACC summons 9 Sonali Bank officials
The Anti-Corruption Commission has summoned nine officials of Sonali Bank's Laldighi corporate office for grilling as part of its investigation into the embezzlement of Tk 70 billion from nine branches of the bank.

ACC deputy director Mir Mohammad Zainul Abedin Shibli on Sunday issued a summon notice to the Sonali Bank officials to face the anti-graft watchdog on 8 and 9 July.

The officials who were summoned to face the ACC include the then deputy director general of the bank SM Belayet Hossain, its assistant director general Ranjit Kumar Das, officials Salehuddin, Zinat Rehena, Mahbubul Haque, Mashuk Ali, Shuvash Kumar Chowdhury, Mong Hola Ching and Nurul Alam.

According to ACC sources, a probe body was formed in August last year to investigate the Tk 70 billion embezzlement from Sonali Bank.

The probe committee has, so far, completed quizzing officials of eight branches except the Laldighi corporate office.
