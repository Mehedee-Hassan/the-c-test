2 Jubo League activists held over UNO assault
A case was filed against 60 people and two Jubo League activists were held on Wednesday night in connection with assaulting Nawabganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) over guard recruitment.

Additional Deputy Commissioner Abu Rayhan Miah filed the case at night.

Later, police launched an overnight drive and arrested Mannan and Alam, activists of Nawabganj upazila unit Jubo League.

Some leaders and activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League allegedly attacked the UNO office and beat up UNO Sayed Farhad Hossain over the recruitment of some night guards in 39 primary schools in the upazila Wednesday morning.

The BCL men allegedly wanted to cancel the appointment of 39 night guards, who were recruited eight months back and had been demanding for recruiting their own people in the posts.

The injured UNO was shifted to Nawabganj Upazila Health Complex and later he was shifted to Rangpur Medical College for better treatment.
