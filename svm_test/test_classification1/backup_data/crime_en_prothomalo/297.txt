Nation united against terrorism under Hasina's leadership: Tofail
Commerce minister Tofail Ahmed on Saturday said the whole nation is now united against terrorism and militancy under the leadership of prime minister Sheikh Hasina.



The minister passed this remark at a rally organised by district Awami League against militancy, terrorism, secret killing and anarchy at Bangla School field.



He alleged that the BNP is making jokes in the name of national unity keeping alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami. "International Crime Tribunals has identified Jamaat as a terrorist organization. So, BNP's call of national unity, even after keeping tie with Jamaat, is nothing but cheating with the people of the country."

Through the killing of father of the nation and members of his family, the assassins had thought that Awami League (AL) would disappear from the country, Tofail said, adding that "AL under the dynamic leadership of Sheikh Hasina has reemerged overcoming all hurdles and now, Sheikh Hasina appeared as the world leader."

Referring to the dream of father of the nation to turn the country into "Sonar Bangla", the veteran AL leader said: "we are working with the leadership of his daughter towards making the country 'Sonar Bangla' and no evil force could resist this journey."

District AL general secretary and district administrator Abdul Mamin Tulu, sadar upazila AL president and upazila chairman Mosharef Hossain and general secretary Nazrul Islam Goldar, among others, spoke on the occasion with district AL senior vice president Dusto Mahmud in the chair.

Later, an anti-terrorism procession was brought out that paraded through the main roads of the town.
