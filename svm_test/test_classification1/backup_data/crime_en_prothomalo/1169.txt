PM hints at suspension of WhatsAPP, Viber
The government, if required, would terminate operation of cross-platform messaging apps like WhatsAPP and Viber for a certain period to check cyber crime and nab the militants and terrorists, reports state-run news agency BSS.



The prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, said this in reply to a question from independent member Haji Selim during the Prime Minister's question answer session in the parliament on Wednesday.



She said every good work has some demerits. “People of Bangladesh are enjoying the benefit of Digital Bangladesh. Taking the advantage of the digital services, a section of people are doing crime, causing sufferings for others.”

So, if required, cross-platform message apps would remain suspended for a few days to find the links of the criminals and nab them, the prime minister said.

Sheikh Hasina urged the countrymen and media to help the law enforcing agencies to arrest cyber criminals. The government is pledge-bound to take any step to protect the lives and property of the people, she said.

The prime minister alleged the “anti-liberation force” and the activists of Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamaat-e-Islami are committing such crimes one after another.
