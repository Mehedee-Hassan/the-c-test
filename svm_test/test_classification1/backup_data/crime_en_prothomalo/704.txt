People to not accept relocation of Zia's grave: Fakhrul
BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Friday warned the government against relocation of the grave of former president Ziaur Rahman from capital’s Agargaon saying the country people will never accept it, reports UNB.



“Bringing Louis I Kahn's main design (of parliament) abruptly is a blueprint and the main motive behind is to remove Ziaur Rahman's grave. People will never accept it and allow them (government) to make it happen," he said.



Fakhrul further said, "This government is deliberately trying to eliminate the names and signs of the main heroes of the liberation war, especially that of Ziaur Rahman who proclaimed the independence of Bangladesh. But, it won't be possible to do that as his name his deeply rooted in people's hearts. No conspiracy can separate Zia from people," he said.



The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader made the remarks while placing wreaths at Ziaur Rahman's grave along with leaders and activists of Jatiyatabadi Muktijoddha Projonmo, marking its founding anniversary.

The government brought back Louis I Kahn's original design of parliament complex on Thursday last from the US' Pennsylvania University.

Housing and public works ministry last year proposed removing eight graves, including BNP founder Zia's one, and some other establishments, set up in the parliament area distorting the original design of Louis I Kahn.

As per the original design, the Bangladesh Secretariat was supposed to be there at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar.

After his assassination at Chittagong Circuit House on 30 May 1981, Ziaur Rahman was primarily buried at Rangunia in Chittagong on the same day, but his body was retrieved from the grave and flown to Dhaka the following day and buried at Chandrima Udyan in the parliament complex.

Fakhrul said the liberation war spirit is now deported while freedom fighters are being repressed under the rule of current Bangladesh Awami League-led government.

He also alleged that the government is plotting to keep BNP leaders away from politics as it has got isolated from people.

About Narayanganj city polls, the BNP leader said his party thinks there is no possibility of a fair election under the current election commission. "We're in the election race for the sake of democracy, though the commission has no capability to hold an acceptable election."

Fakhrul renewed his party's demand for army deployment during the civic polls for ensuring a fair balloting.
