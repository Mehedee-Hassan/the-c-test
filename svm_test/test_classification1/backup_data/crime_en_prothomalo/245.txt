BNP to stage demo countrywide except Dhaka
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Thursday will stage protest rallies across the country protesting at the police attack on its activists in front of a Special Court on Dhaka Alia Madrasah ground and vandalism of its Bogra office on Wednesday.

The party will observe the programme in all metropolis and district towns except Dhaka.

BNP joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi announced the programme at the party's Naya Paltan central office.

Earlier, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia appeared before the makeshift court at Bakshibazar Alia Madrasah of Dhaka in the Zia Charitable Trust and Zia Orphanage Trust graft cases. BNP men and police then were entangled in clash.
