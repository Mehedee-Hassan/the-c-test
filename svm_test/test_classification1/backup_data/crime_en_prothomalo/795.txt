'95 extrajudicial killings since Jan'
At least 95 people fell victim to extrajudicial killings in the first five months of the year, says rights group Odhikar.

Eighteen of them were killed only in the month of May.

Some 20 Bangladeshi nationals were killed by members of India’s Border Security Force (BSF) since the beginning of the year, according to Adhikar’s report released on Tuesday.

BSF men also injured 29 more Bangladeshis and kidnapped another 16 people along the border during the period.

The country’s law enforcement agencies shot (at leg) as many as 30 people in the five months. And 30 more people were victims of enforced disappearance in the year.

On top of these, 137 people were killed and 3783 injured in political violence since January.

Fifty seven people died of mob beating during the period, the report added.

Odhikar demanded an end to the culture of extrajudicial killing and bringing to book the members of the law enforcement agencies responsible for the incidents.

For the sake of peaceful political process, the rights organisation also demanded holding of general elections immediately under a neutral government or under the supervision of the United Nations.

Referring to killing by BSF, Odhikar said steps should be taken to claim compensation from the Indian government and ensure safe living of the people along the border.

The year 2015 saw incidents of rape numbering at 233 and 75 of the incidents were recorded in May. The number of sexual harassment was 62.

As many as 73 people fell victim to violence over dowry claims and another 24 were injured when acid was thrown on them.

During the period, 46 journalists were injured and 15 threatened. Three more were assaulted and another journalist met with repression. Five journalists were arrested during the period, the report also said.
