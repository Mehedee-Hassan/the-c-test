SC defers Nizami review plea hearing
The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on Sunday deferred hearing on the review appeal filed by death row convict Jamaat leader Matiur Rahman Nizami for a week.



Hearing on Nizami’s appeal seeking review of his death penalty will be held next week, the court said.



An Appellate Division bench-led by chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha passed the order on Sunday.



On 30 March, the apex court fixed 3 April for hearing the review plea of Jamaat chief Nizami, a day after he filed the petition.

On 6 January, a four-member bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha, upheld the International Crimes Tribunal-1 order that sentenced Nizami to death for crimes against humanity, including genocide and murder of intellectuals, during the liberation war.

The International Crimes Tribunal-1 delivered the judgement on Nizami's case on 29 October 2014.

Nizami filed an appeal with the Supreme Court on 23 November 2014 challenging the death sentence and claimed himself innocent and sought to be cleared of the charges.
