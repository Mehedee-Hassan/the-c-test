Pirates kidnap 14 fishermen in Patuakhali
Pirates kidnapped 14 fishermen from the Bay of Bengal under Kalapara upazila of Patuakhali on Tuesday.

Local people said a gang of bandits belonging to ‘Raja Bahini’ swooped on two trawlers at about10:00am while some fishermen were netting fish at Char Gangamati adjacent to Kuakata sea beach.

The gangsters looted fish and nets from the trawlers and fled into the deep sea taking 14 fishermen along with a fishing boat with them.

The pirates demanded ransom for the release of the abducted fisherman.

Kuakata police sub-inspector Sanjay Mondal confirmed the incident.
