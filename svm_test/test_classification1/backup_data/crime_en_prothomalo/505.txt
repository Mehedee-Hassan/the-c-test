ACC calls for legal action against five secretaries
The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has recommended that the freedom fighter certificates of four secretaries, including Health Secretary Niaz Uddin Miah, and a joint secretary, be cancelled and legal action be taken against them. ACC's inquiries have proven true the allegations made about the irregularities in the process of acquiring these certificates.

ACC sent a letter in this regard, yesterday, Monday, to the Ministry of Public Administration and the Ministry of Liberation War Affairs. The accused secretaries are Secretary for Liberation War Affairs (recently made OSD) KH Masud Siddiqui, Public Service Commission (PSC) Secretary AKM Amir Hossain, former Secretary of the Prime Minister's Secretariat Molla Wahiduzzaman (presently Chairman of the Privatisation Commission with the status of state minister), Joint Secretary of the Liberation War Ministry (OSD) Abul Kalam Talukdar.

ACC Chairman Mohammed Badiuzzaman yesterday told Prothom Alo that irregularities were found in the process of acquiring the certificates.

Concerning what action should be taken against such matters, former Cabinet Secretary Akbar Ali Khan said a departmental case can be filed against them for breach of discipline. And if fraud can be proven, they a case in that regard can be filed.
