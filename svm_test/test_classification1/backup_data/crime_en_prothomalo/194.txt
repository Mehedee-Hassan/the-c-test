Verdict on crimes against humanity of Taher, Noni tomorrow
The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) is set to deliver its verdicts on the crime against humanity allegedly committed by Netrokona’s Obaidul Haque Taher and Ataur Rahman Noni tomorrow (Tuesday), reports UNB news agency.



The three-member tribunal, headed by justice M Anwarul Haque, on Monday fixed the date for the verdict, said prosecutor Mokhlesur Rahman Badal.

Obaidul Haque Taher and Ataur Rahman Noni are now in jail.



On 10 January, closing the law-point arguments from both sides in the trial, the ICT kept pending its verdict for anyday.



The accused duo are facing six charges, including those for mass killing, abduction, looting and arson attack, during the 1971 Liberation War.



In compliance with the tribunal order, police arrested Taher and Nani from Netrakona on 12 August last year.
