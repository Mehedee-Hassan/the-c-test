AL MP Liton denied bail
A Gaibandha court on Sunday denied bail to Manjurul Islam Liton, ruling Awami League MP from Gaibandha-1 constituency, in a case filed for shooting a minor boy.

Additional chief judicial magistrate Mohammad Waheduzzaman passed the order after hearing a petition filed seeking Liton’s bail.

Earlier, Liton’s lawyer Sirajul Islam submitted two petitions seeking bail in two cases--one for shooting a minor boy and another for vandalising and looting a house-- with the chief judicial magistrate’s court on 21 October.

The chief judicial magistrate fixed 25 October (Sunday) for hearing the pleas.

On 14 October, detectives arrested MP Liton from the city’s Uttara area in connection with the two cases.

On 15 October, following his arrest Liton was taken to Gaibandha.

The arrest had come hours after the Supreme Court (SC) stayed a High Court order directing the ruling party MP to surrender before a lower court by 18 October in the cases.

The SC passed the stay order following a petition filed by the state on 13 October.

On 2 October, minor boy Sourav, 8, son of Sazu Miah of Gopalcharan village, suffered wounds to his both legs with bullets allegedly fired by Manjurul Islam Liton at the village in Sundarganj upazila.

Sazu filed an attempted murder case against Liton the following day.

Liton remained ‘on the run’ since the incident.

On 8 October, another case was filed against him on charge of vandalising and looting a house.
