Hannan Shah cleared of graft charges
The Supreme Court (SC) on Sunday upheld a High Court (HC) order that quashed the proceedings of a corruption case filed by the now-defunct Anti Corruption Bureau against BNP standing committee member ASM Hannan Shah.

A four-member bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha, passed the order rejecting the leave to appeal filed by the Anti Corruption Commission (ACC).

Senior lawyer AJ Mohammad Ali led the hearing on behalf of Hannan Shah while Sarwar Ahmed represented the ACC.

On 19 February in 1997, the Anti Corruption Bureau, now Anti Corruption Commission, had filed a case against Hannan Shah for incurring losses to the national exchequer by selling Gazraj Panna Lal Company in Mymensigh at Tk 33 lakh instead of worth Tk 1 crore.

Police submitted charge sheet against him on 9 September in the same year.

On 20 June, 2012, the HC quashed the case proceedings.

Later, the ACC filed a leave to appeal with the apex court.
