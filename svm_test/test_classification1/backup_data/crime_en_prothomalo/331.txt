'14-party to form anti-terrorism committees all over country'
The Awami League-led 14-party alliance will form anti-terrorism committees in every lanes across the country to thwart 'subversive activities' of the BNP-led 20-party alliance.

Health minister and spokesperson of the 14-party alliance Mohammad Nasim said this at a press conference at the political office of the AL president following a meeting of the alliance there.

Nasim said the committees will unite the country against terrorism. They will identify criminals and hand them over to law enforcement agencies.

On not letting BNP hold their rally, he said that the 14-party alliance is not against any democratic agitation programme. "They can hold any peaceful programme with the permission of the law enforcement agencies."
