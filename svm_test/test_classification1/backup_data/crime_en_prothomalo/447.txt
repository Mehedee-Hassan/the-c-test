ICC rejects BNP-Jamaat’s allegations of mass killing: Minister
Foreign minister AH Mahmood Ali on Wednesday claimed that the International Criminal Court (ICC) has rejected a ‘false and baseless’ allegations raised by the BNP and its ally Jamaat-e-Islami accusing the government of resorting to “mass killing and crimes against humanity” in Bangladesh since 2013.



“The allegations brought by BNP-Jamaat have no legal basis,” the foreign minister told reporters at a press conference at the foreign ministry, quoting the “content of the letter sent by the ICC prosecutor from the Hague, the Netherlands.”



Mahmood Ali claimed that the ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, informed it to Bangladesh government a couple of days back.



The Office of The Prosecutor (OTP) is an independent organ of the ICC and is responsible for examining situations under the jurisdiction of the Court where genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes appear to have been committed, and carrying out investigations and prosecutions against the individuals who are allegedly most responsible for those crimes.
