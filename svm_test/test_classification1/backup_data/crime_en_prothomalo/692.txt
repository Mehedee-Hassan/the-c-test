Sajeeb demands Daily Star editor be behind bars
Prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s son Sajeeb Wazed Joy on Friday demanded the English-language daily The Daily Star editor, Mahfuz Anam, be behind bars for “publishing false corruption stories to defame her mother.”



Also the ICT adviser to the prime minister, Sajeeb Wazed made the demand in a Facebook post following The Daily Star editor’s confession that the daily had to publish some stories under pressure like other dailies in the country during the military-propelled caretaker government.



“Mahfuz Anam, editor of The Daily Star, has admitted he published false corruptions stories against my mother prime minister Sheikh Hasina to defame her. He did this in support of a military dictatorship in an attempt to remove my mother from politics,” read Sajeeb’s Facebook status.

He also put up the link of a story of an online news portal about Mahfuz’s confession.



Sajeeb Wazed also alleged, “The editor of a major newspaper running a false smear campaign to assist in a military coup is treason.”



The Facebook status further read, “He [Mahfuz Anam] is constantly writing against politicians as being unethical and corrupt. By his own admission he is completely unethical and a liar. He certainly has no right to remain a journalist, let alone an editor. His activities went beyond just being corrupt. They were unpatriotic and anti-Bangladesh.”



“On a personal note,” Sajeeb continued saying, “his false stories led to my mother’s arrest and spending 11 months in jail. I demand justice. I want Mahfuz Anam behind bars and on trial for treason.”
