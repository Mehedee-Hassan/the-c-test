Owner of car that killed couple identified


The private car that killed the couple, Ataur Rahman and his wife Rawshan Ara, in Dhaka's Shewrapara area on Wednesday morning belongs to a person named Ashikur Rahman Khan.

However, an official concerned said, the person who was driving the car during the mishap was Ashikur Rahman’s son Nafis Khan.

The identity of the owner of the car was confirmed by an official of the Bangladesh Road and Transport Authority (BRTA), who wanted not to be named.

The police said they would not publish any names related to this case, as yet.

“We have secured all the information. Now we are waiting to find the culprits. I cannot reveal more for the sake of the investigation,” officer in charge of Kafrul police station Shamim Shikdar told Prothom Alo.

None of the suspects has been arrested as yet.

Ataur Rahman and his wife Rawshan Ara were standing in front of Haji Ashraf Ali Market when the car hit them, leaving them dead on the spot.

Witnesses said they saw three youths running away leaving the wrecked car after the incident.

Ashikur Rahman’s identification papers and a bottle of liquor were found in the car -- something which suggested that whoever was driving was drunk.

Ataur Rahman’s son, Md. Rayhan, is in the dark as to the progress of the investigation. “The police have not informed me about the people who were involved in the mishap. Even if they are identified, will justice be delivered?” he asked.
