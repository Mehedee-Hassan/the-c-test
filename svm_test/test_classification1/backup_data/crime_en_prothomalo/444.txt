Writ seeks opening up of border for Rohingyas
A writ petition has sought suspending the official step to stop Rohingya Muslims, who are being subject to persecution in Myanmar state of Rakhine, from entering into Bangladesh territory.

The petition has also called for opening up of Bangladesh's border with Myanmar for the time being to provide shelter to the Rohingya people.

The writ petition was filed with the High Court on Monday, said Abu Yahiya Dulal, a lawyer of the Supreme Court.

The writ seeks to declare as illegal the action to prevent that the border guards call infiltration of Rohingyas into Bangladesh in the wake of repression on them.

The writ has applied for rule in this regard and for provisional order until hearing of the case.

"The writ petition will be presented for hearing at the court on Tuesday," said the lawyer.

The home secretary, the inspector general of the police, the director general of the Boarder Guards Bangladesh, and the director general of the Coast Guard have been made respondents in the writ petition.
