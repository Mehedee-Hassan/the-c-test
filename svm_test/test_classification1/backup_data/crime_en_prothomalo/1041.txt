Bagerhat youths sued on rape charge
Four days after the arrest of three youths in connection with the rape of a schoolgirl and spreading out video footage through mobile phone at Alukdia village of Sadar upazila, police on Wednesday filed a case against the trio and other unidentified persons.





A police team conducted a drive and arrested the trio from the village on Saturday evening on information that some youths were showing the video footage of a rape incident through mobile phones in front of the house of Shariful Sheikh at the village, said sub-inspector (SI) Ramesh Chandra Sen of Bagerhat Model police station.



The arrested are Shariful Sheikh, 18, Anwar Sheikh alias Ano, 18, and Sohag Sheikh, 19, all hailing from the village.



SI Ramesh said the three forcefully took the schoolgirl, a class VII student of Alukdia village, to a grove at the village and raped her on 17 March. They also shot the rape scene with a mobile camera and later showed the video footage to others, the SI added.



Police also seized the mobile phone where the video footage was stored, the SI added.



Officer-in-charge of Bagerhat Model police station Md Mizanur Rahman said police contacted the family members of the victim following the arrest of the three youths, but no one of the family appeared at the police station to lodge any complaint in this connection.



On Sunday, the youths were shown arrested under section 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and produced before the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate.



Later on Wednesday noon, police filed a case against the trio and some other unidentified persons under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act 2000 and the Information and Communication Technology (Amendment) Act 2013.
