Univ teachers react to Muhith remarks
Leaders of agitating university teachers on Tuesday strongly criticised the remark by finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, terming his comments as “not only uncalled for but also inconsistent.”

Earlier in the day, the minister said the university teachers are demonstrating against the new pay scale for the public servants for their lack of knowledge.

In their rebuttal, the teachers’ leaders, in a statement, said for all practical purposes the finance minister has made such “irresponsible remark” for his 'own lack of knowledge' about the teachers and the educational activities.

They also said they do not think that they would get justice from the minister.

The statement signed by Bangladesh University Shikkhak Samity Federation president Farid Uddin Ahmed and secretary general ASM Maksud Kamal read, “We've observed with regret that the finance minister has made some ugly remarks about the teachers which are not only uncalled for, but also inconsistent.”

“The finance minister had made such remarks about others in the past, too. With these remarks, he has already made himself a laughing stock before the nation,” it added.

Fearing that the teachers would not get justice from the minister, the statement shed light on the finance minister’s remark on the Hall-Mark and Basic bank scams in which the minister termed a trifle matter the embezzlement of several thousand crores of take from the banks.

The teachers said it is a gross indecency when a person like him who considers the big financial scams like Hall-Mark and Basic bank scams worth nothing makes comment about teachers.
