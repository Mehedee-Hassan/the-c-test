Why RAB officers not arrested for 7-murder: Court


Narayanganj judicial magistrate court issued a show case notice on 7-murder case investigation officer as to why RAB 11 former commanding officer Tareque Sayeed Mohammad and major Arif Hossain would not be shown arrested in 7-murder case of Narayanganj.

Narayanganj senior judicial magistrate K M Mohiuddin on Sunday asked the police officer, inspector Mamunur Rashid, who is also officer-in-charge of detective branch (DB) police, to respond to the court notice within four days.

The two sacked army officials were arrested under section 54 for their alleged involvement in 7-murder and abduction case of Narayanganj.

Court granted a five-day remand for quizzing the two officials on Saturday.

District Lawyer Association president Shakhwat Hossain and others submitted a petition during the hearing of the remand on Saturday to show the two personnel arrested in 7-murder case.

On the basis of this petition court issued the show cause notice on Sunday.
