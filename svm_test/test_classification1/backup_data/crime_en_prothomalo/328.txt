Bangladesh to fight terrorism, militancy: PM
Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday said that Bangladesh would do everything necessary to fight the twin social monsters—terrorism and militancy.

She said Bangladesh has always played a strong role in combating terrorism and militancy and adopted a “zero tolerance” policy against the twin demons. “We have taken a decision that we won’t give shelter to terrorism and militancy anyway,” she said, reports state-owned news agency BSS.

The Leader of the House came up with this assertion while replying to a supplementary question raised by treasury bench member Md Shahiduzzaman Sarkar (Naogaon-2) during her question hour in the House.

“I have already told the Saudi King, other Muslim countries and the OIC [Organization of Islamic Cooperation] about our resolute stance against terrorism and militancy ... we’re firm to check recurrence of such incidents that are happening,” she said.

Describing Islam as the religion of peace, the Leader of the House said her government’s strides to take Islam to the peak would continue.

The prime minister said Bangladesh has joined the Saudi-led Islamic alliance against terrorism and militancy along with 40 Muslim countries. “An opportunity has been created for the entire Muslim Ummah to work against the twin demons,” she said.

Sheikh Hasina said she always calls upon the Muslim Ummah to be united and put up a resistance against terrorism and militancy. “Whenever I went to the OIC, I raises this issue every time,” she said.
