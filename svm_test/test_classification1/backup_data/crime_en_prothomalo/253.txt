Mosaddek Ali placed on 5-day remand
Mosaddek Ali Falu, an adviser to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, was placed on a five-day remand on Monday.



Police had appealed for a 10-day remand producing the BNP leader before the court, but metropolitan magistrate Hasibul Haq granted only five days after the hearing on arson and vandalism cases.



Mosaddek was picked up by police from in front of Khaleda's Gulshan political office in the city on Sunday night. He was then taken to Detective Branch (DB) headquarters.
