Tazia blast grenades similar to ones seized earlier
The grenades used in the Tazia blast in Old Dhaka on early Saturday are identical to those seized from militants in Chittagong and Ashulia bank robbery earlier this year, Rapid Action Battalion officials said.



Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) claimed they recovered a total of seven grenades, similar to those used in the Tazia blast, from Kamrangirchar on Friday.



RAB additional director general Col Ziaul Ahsan told Prothom Alo the grenades they recovered from arms and ammunitions of militant outfit Shaheed Hamza Brigade’s possession in February and April this year, and robbery of Ashulia’s Commerce Bank on 21 April are similar with those used in the Tazia blast.



According to RAB sources, the elite force arrested a total of 24 members of Hamza Brigade in separate drives from Chittagong in February and April this year.



They recovered five AK-22 rifles, huge numbers of arms and ammunitions as well as grenades from them.



According Dhaka district police, banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) was involved in carrying out the robbery at the Ashulia's Kathgora branch of Bangladesh Commerce Bank on 21 April that left at least nine people dead and 16 others injured.



Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner Asaduzzaman Mia said the grenades used in Old Dhaka resemble the one they recovered from a Kamrangirchar residence on Friday as part of their investigation into the murder of a police officer at Gabtali area.



This proves that the explosions at the Shia gathering and murder of the ASI at Gabtali are linked, Asaduzzaman Mia added.



Three explosions at a gathering of Shia Muslims outside the Huseni Dalan early Saturday that left one dead and more than 100 injured.



On Thursday night, an assistant sub inspector (ASI) was stabbed to death at a check post in Dhaka’s Gabtali.
