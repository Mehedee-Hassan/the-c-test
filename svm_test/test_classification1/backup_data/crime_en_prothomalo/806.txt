Journo sent to jail for 'killing' wife
A Faridpur court on Saturday sent Panna Bala, the district correspondent of Bangla daily Prothom Alo, to jail in a case filed against him on charge of murdering his wife for dowry.

Judicial magistrate court judge Mrityunjay Mristri passed the order after police produced Panna, arrested on Friday night, before it at noon.

Also in the day, Monaz Sarkar, Joyanti's elder brother, lodged a case against Panna, his mother Anjali Bala and sister Tripti Bala accusing them of murdering Joyanti.

As per the case statement, Joyanti was married off to Panna 11 years back and they are blessed with a 10-year-old daughter Kasturi Bala.

However, soon after the marriage, Panna and his family members used to torture Joyanti on various excuses, including dowry.

They killed Joyanti and hanged the body to make it appear that she committed suicide, it was stated in the case statement.

Besides, the fingers of the victim's hands were blue-coloured. The IO expected that they would be able to ascertain whether Joyanti committed suicide or was murdered.
