Ivy says no to army, this time
Ruling Bangladesh Awami League-backed mayoral candidate Selina Hayat Ivy on Thursday said she does not want military troops to be deployed in the Narayanganj civic polls slated for 22 December.



Also the immediate-past mayor, Ivy had demanded army deployment during the 2011 mayoral election when she as an independent candidate fought against the then ruling AL blessed candidate Shamim Osman.



“There is no need for army deployment as the upcoming NCC polls will be held in a free and fair manner,” Ivy was quoted to have said by UNB news agency.



Ivy came up with the remark while talking to reporters after submitting her nomination paper around 11:15am.



She urged all to maintain a peaceful atmosphere ahead of the election.



Meanwhile, opposition BNP nominated mayoral candidate Shakhawat Hossain on Thursday iterated his demand for army deployment in the election to ensure a free, fair and smooth balloting.

Shakhawat Hossain, along with senior leaders of the city unit, went to district Election Commission (EC) office around 12:00pm and submitted his nomination paper.

“Deployment of Army is essential to ensure a ‘level-playing field’ in the upcoming election,” said Sakhawat while talking to journalists after submitting his paper.

He also urged the district administration to withdraw its ‘corrupt officials’ ahead of the election.
