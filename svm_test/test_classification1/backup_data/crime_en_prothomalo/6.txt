SI Zahid held over custodial killing
Though late, Mirpur police on Wednesday held suspended sub-inspector Zahidur Rahman Khan on charges of killing a man in police custody.

There was allegation against Zahid, who had been earlier suspended over the same case, that he had beaten one Mahabubur Rahman Sujan, 35, to death in police custody.

Dhaka Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner (Mirpur division) Imtiaz Ahmed confirmed the arrest saying since Mahabubur's family brought accusation against SI Zahid and when the autopsy report of the deceased also indicated the death to be a homicide the police arrested him immediately.

It was known that Zahid also has three more murder allegations against him in the current year apart from than that of Mahabubur.
