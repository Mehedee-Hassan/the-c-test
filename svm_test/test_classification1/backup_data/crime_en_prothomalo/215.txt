Govt seeks stay on HC order against MP over shooting boy
The government filed a petition with the Supreme Court (SC) on Tuesday seeking stay on the High Court order that directed Gaibandha-1 MP Manjurul Islam Liton to surrender before a lower court.

On Monday, the HC rejected the bail petition filed by Liton and asked him to surrender before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court of Gaibandha by October 18 in a case for shooting a minor boy.

A two-member bench of Justice M Enayetur Rahim and Justice Bhishmadev Chakraborty passed the order after a hearing on the bail petition.

Earlier on Sunday, the Gaibandha-1 constituency lawmaker filed the petition with the High Court seeking anticipatory bail in the case.

On October 2, minor boy Sourav, 8, son of Sazu Miah of Gopalcharan village, was injured in his both legs with bullets allegedly fired by Manjurul Islam Liton, MP, at the village in Sundarganj upazila of Rangpur.

A case was filed against Liton the following day by Sazu Miah for attempting to kill his son.

Liton has remained ‘on the run’ since the incident.

On October 8, another case was filed against Liton on charge of vandalism and looting.

Besides, the licences of two firearms of the lawmaker were revoked for ‘the sake of public safety’.
