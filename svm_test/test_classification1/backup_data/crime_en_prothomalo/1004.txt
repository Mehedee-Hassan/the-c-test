Khaleda received money from ISI: Joy
Prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s son Sajeeb Wazed Joy has alleged that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson, Khaleda Zia, has repeatedly taken money from Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) for elections.



He came up with the allegation in a status on his Facebook page early Tuesday, said UNB news agency.

“I’ve said before that Khaleda Zia is a Pakistani agent. She has repeatedly taken money from ISI agents for elections. She has made war criminals Ministers,” Joy said.



He further said, “Now the Pakistani Government is openly lobbying on her behalf.”

Joy, also the prime minister’s ICT affairs adviser, shared a link of a news portal headlined ‘Pakistan lobbies for BNP chief Khaleda Zia in Commonwealth’.

Earlier on 2 May, Joy also branded Khaleda as a liar and thief, and asked her not to throw mud at Bangabandhu’s grandson.
