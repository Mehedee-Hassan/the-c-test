The Jahangirnagar University authorities on Thursday suspended eight students in connection with sexual harassment of a female student of the university during the Pahela Baishakh celebration.

University registrar Abu Bakar Siddique confirmed it to Prothom Alo on Friday.

According to the administrative sources, the university vice-chancellor suspended the eight students temporarily with a special power. An order has been issued in this regard without mentioning names of the accused students.

JU university vice-chancellor Farjana Islam said eight students have been suspended in an administrative order. The names of the alleged assailants were not revealed as they are yet to be proved accused.

An indigenous female student of the botany department was assaulted by five members of Bangladesh Chhatra League JU unit during the Pahela Baishkh celebration on Tuesday evening.

The assaulted student submitted a written allegation to the university VC on Thursday. Later, the VC forwarded the latter to the university's anti-harassment cell.

The anti-harassment cell chief, Rasheda Akhtar said, “We are trying to sit in a meeting after getting the accusation. We will start to work on it in no time.”

The Teacher-Student Unity Platform announced a human-chain and gathering programmes at 11:00am on Saturday.

The organisation also demanded permanent suspension of the assailants.

Raihan Rain, teacher of the philosophy department said, “We will submit memorandum to the VC after tomorrow’s programme.”
