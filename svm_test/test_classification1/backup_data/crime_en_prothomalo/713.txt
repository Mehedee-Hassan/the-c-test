‘AL hell-bent on power thru repressive means’
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson, Khaleda Zia, on Friday alleged the ruling Awami League has been hell-bent on sticking to the state power through gagging people’s voice and repressions.

“Democracy and the values, and promises of Liberation War come under threat when the country plunges into misrule,” said Khaleda in a message on the occasion of the National Revolution and Solidarity Day to be observed on 7 November.

“A government is now in the state power in Bangladesh which is established without any election. They are hell-bent on sticking to the state power through gagging people’s voice using repressive measures,” she alleged.

She went on saying, “This misrule must come to an end. The people can express their desire against autocratic regime only if they get back their rights to vote.”

Also former prime minister, Khaleda urged all nationalist and patriotic forces to forge unity being imbued with the spirit of the 7 November.

Dwelling on the National Revolution and Solidarity Day, an occasion the BNP and its like-minded forces observe on 7 November, Khaleda said, “A large faction of Awami League staged an uprising on 15 August, 1975 when an ideological dispute reached its peak within the party which introduced one-party BKSAL rule.”

Khaleda said, “As a continuation to that uprising, a section in the armed forces put the then army chief and the proclaimer of independence Ziaur Rahman under house arrest inside the cantonment on 3 November in the year.”

Ziaur Rahman, who was made the army chief after the assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was put under house arrest after a military uprising by Khaled Mosharraf, a sector commander during the Liberation War.

Later, Zia was freed by soldiers through a mass uprising on 7 November 1975.
