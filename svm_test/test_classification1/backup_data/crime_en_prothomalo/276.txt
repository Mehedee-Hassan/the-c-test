'BNP going to be terrorist party'
Terming BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia a villain of the current politics, information minister Hasanul Haq Inu said she would turn into the future leader of terrorism and militancy.

He said this at Dhaka Reporters Unity on Saturday when newsmen asked him whether Khaleda Zia would be arrested soon.

"The way she is running her party will ensure that the BNP will turn into a terrorist party and Khaleda Zia a leader of terrorism and militancy.. Action will then be taken accordingly," he said.

The minister did not give a direct answer to the query if the BNP would be banned.

Inu, also a leader of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, said the government will not bow down to terrorism and militancy. "We will not give in," he said and also called upon the people not to surrender to the terrorist and militant elements.

"We've taken the challenge of addressing terrorism and militancy and the situation will improve soon," he expressed optimism.
