BNP men assault MP Chhabi Biswas, torch his car
A number of BNP activists on Wednesday assaulted Chhabi Biswas, a parliamentarian from Netrakona-1 constituency, in front of Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH).

Witnesses said the BNP activists attacked the car carrying Chhabi Biswas while she was leaving DMCH after visiting a patient.

The miscreants hit Chhabi Bsiwas with a stick on his head when he tried to stop the attacker, who also torched the MP's vehicle.

The parliamentarian was then rushed to the emergency unit of DMCH.
