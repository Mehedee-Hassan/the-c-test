Muhith says sorry for remarks on university teachers
Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith on Thursday apologised for his remarks against the movement of public university teachers seeking for a separate pay scale, according to UNB news agency.

“I’m sorry for my remarks if those hurt anybody. What has happened is over here, I’ve withdrawn my remarks,” said the minister at a press briefing at local Circuit House.

Talking to the media on Tuesday, Muhith criticised the teachers' movement saying, "We’ve to control the corrupt practices of teachers. I don't see any reason why public university teachers are demanding a separate pay scale. The highly educated section is demonstrating for lack of knowledge."

Earlier on Monday, the cabinet, avoiding traditional selection grades and time scale, approved the long-awaited pay scale for public servants.

The Federation of Bangladesh University Teachers' Associations (FBUTA) on Wednesday asked Finance Minister AMA Muhith to apologise within 24 hours for his “funny” remarks about public university teachers, saying he would be held responsible for any disorder on campuses.
