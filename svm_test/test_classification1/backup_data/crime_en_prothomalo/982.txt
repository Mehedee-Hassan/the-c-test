Police do not kill militants except in self-defence, claims home minister
Home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal on Tuesday claimed that the police don’t kill militants, rather they (police) tackle militants with patience.



"Police carry out attack on militants when they (militants) conduct assaults on the police. Militants are killed in the counter attack," he said, while addressing a function to unveil the cover of a book at a city hotel on Tuesday.



The elite force RAB published the book.

The home minister said people, who think that the (militants) can kill thousands of trained police through hand bombs, are living in "a fool's paradise".

He said not just Islam, no religion supports killing people. "Islam is a religion of peace. It [Islam] talks about humanity and development. There is no space for killing," he said.

Derailed youths have to be brought back to the right path through de-radicalisation and motivation programme, said the home minister.

Among others, Grand Imam of Sholakia Eid Gah Maulana Farid Uddin Masud, director general of Islamic Foundation Md Afzal Shamim, home secretary Kamal Uddin Ahme and IGP AKM Shahidul Hoque addressed the function chaired by director general of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) Benazir Ahmed.
