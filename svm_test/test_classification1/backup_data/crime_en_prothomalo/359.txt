Expelled N Korean diplomat’s Rolls Royce seized
Customs intelligence today seized an expensive private car of Rolls Royce Ghost model of an expelled North Korean diplomat from Kamlapur in the city.

“We seized the silver colour car of 6600cc worth about Tk 300 million from Kamlapur ICT depot today,” director general (DG) of customs intelligence Dr Mainul Khan told BSS.

The car was imported in the name of Han Son Ik, ex-first secretary of the North Korean embassy in Dhaka, with a false declaration that it’s a BMW model car and the tax of the car is Tk 220 million, he also said.

Earlier on August last the diplomat was expelled after accusing him of smuggling banned cigarettes.

Bangladesh earlier expelled a previous North Korean first secretary in March last year after he was caught for smuggling 27 kg (60 lb) of gold - worth $1.4 million - into the country.
