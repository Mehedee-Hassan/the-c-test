‘Vehicle fitness test to be digitalized soon’
Road transport and bridges minister Obaidul Quader on Wednesday said the system of vehicle fitness test would be digitalized soon.

“The government will introduce digitalized vehicle fitness system by inaugurating a new Vehicle Inspection Centre (VIP) with modern equipment and technology in the capital’s Mirpur on 30 October,” he said.

He said this during a sudden visit to Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) office at Mirpur, said a press release.

The minister said, some corrupt officials provide fitness certificate through underhand dealings with vehicle owners. Such ill practices would come to an end when the digital inspection centre starts functioning.

Under the existing manual system, a BRTA inspector inspects fitness status of a vehicle. If the new system is introduced, fitness of vehicles will be checked in a computerized system.
