Man killed in police shootout in Lakshmipur
A suspected robber was reportedly killed in a gunfight with police at Sonapur in Sadar upazila early Saturday.

The deceased was identified as Bashar, son of Sayed Ahmad, a resident of Kazzalipur village in the upazila. He is said to be the chief of notorious terrorist gang ‘Bashar Bahini’.

Abdullah Al Mamun Bhuiyan, officer-in-charge of Sadar Police Station, said acting on secret information that a gang of robbers were taking preparation to commit robbery in the area, a team of police conducted a drive there around 1:30am.

Sensing danger, the robbers opened fire at police, prompting a retaliation that triggered a gunfight.

At one stage, Bashar was caught in the line of fire and injured while others managed to flee the scene.

The injured was taken to Laxmipur Sadar Hospital where doctors declared him dead.

Three policemen - sub-inspector Omar Faruk and constables Kuddus and Utpal - were also injured in the incident.

Police also recovered one light gun, some sharp weapons and five rounds of bullets from the spot.

Bashar was wanted in 15 cases filed for robbery, murder and kidnapping, said the OC.
