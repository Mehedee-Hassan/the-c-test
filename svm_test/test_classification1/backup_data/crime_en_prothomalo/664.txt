Political will essential to curb corruption: ACC
The Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) chairman M Bodiuzzaman said preventing corruption is impossible without political will.

The ACC chairman made this comment at a view-exchange meeting among the high ups of the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of Bangladesh (CAG) , Bangladesh Enterprise Institute (BEI), Information Commission of Bangladesh and ACC at the Segun Bagicha headquarter of ACC on Thursday morning.

Most people of Bangladesh are against corruption, he added.

ACC chairman said lawmakers criticise ACC and other organisations to their hearts' content, but hardly hold any constructive discussion about curbing corruption. Developed countries are successful in this regard only because of their political will, he added.

He also put emphasis on cooperation between ACC, BEI and CAG.

Chief information commissioner Mohammad Faruk said, "Revealing information is a way of curbing corruption." Among the 1100 acts existing in Bangladesh, only right to information act can give people an upper hand over the government, he added.

BEI vice president M Humayun Kobir said they will always extend a helping hand to ACC.

However, ACC faced strong criticism from CAG Masud Ahmed regarding ACC's limited success in curbing corruption.

Mentioning that the lower number of criminals receiving punishment by ACC, Masud Ahmed said, "Society do not get the right message when criminals are not punished for their acts."

He also mentioned the lack of skill and cooperation as a main drawback of ACC.

Later, a committee was formed consisting officials of ACC, BAE and Information commission during the meeting.
