Arrestees confessed to gang rape: RAB
Two men held by the Rapid Action Battalion over the gang-rape of a Garo woman inside a running microbus have confessed to their involvement in the crime, RAB said on Wednesday.

Both the rapists - Ashraf aka Tushar, 36, and Zahidul Islam Lavlu, 26, - are drivers of buying house Signet, said RAB spokesperson Mufti Mahmud Hassan at a press conference at the RAB-1 head office.

RAB arrested Tushar, the prime suspect of the infamous rape case, from the Kolapara area of Patuakhali early Wednesday. Based on the information provided by him, RAB later arrested Lavlu on Wednesday morning from Gulshan-1 area of the capital, Mufti added.

He said on 17 May, Tushar, along with two African clients of the buying house he works for, went to the Textmart showroom of Jamuna Future Park where the victim works as a sales person. Tushar had a conversation with the woman, and offered her a job. He kept in touch with her for the next three days regarding that job offer.

On 21 May, after the woman finished her shift and left her workplace, Tushar and his companion Lavlu met her on her way home and offered her a ride on their microbus. When she refused, they forcefully dragged her inside the microbus.

Quoting the culprits, the RAB spokesperson said, Tushar and Lavlu later took turns raping the woman inside that running micro, all along threatening to kill her.

Tushar said that they planned the rape on 18 May. Another driver named Firoze was also with them.

The RAB spokesperson claimed Tushar was the mastermind of this crime. Tushar and Lavlu both were involved in this crime, he added.

RAB has confiscated the microbus used in the crime.
