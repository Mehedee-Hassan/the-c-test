KPPL's IPO subscription postponed
The High Court ordered to postpone subscription receiving of the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Khulna Printing and Packaging Limited (KPPL).

The court also issued a rule asking as to why action should not be taken against receiving subscription.

A High Court bench comprising Justice Mirza Hossain Haider and Justice Muhammad Khurshed Alam Sarkar passed the order on Wednesday.

Earlier a writ petition was submitted in the court of lawyer Raihanul Mostafa.

The petitioner's lawyer Ziaur Rahman told Prothom Alo that after the hearing the court ordered to postpone receiving of KPPL IPO subscription for two weeks.

He also said that the writ petition was submitted considering the general investors on the base of newspaper reports.

A report on KPPL's forgery was published in Prothom Alo on 30 April. But the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSIC) did not take any action in this connection.
