Truck torched in Natore, driver beaten, robbed
Miscreants set fire to a cement-laden truck on Dhaka-Natore highway at Boraigram upazila in the district early Thursday.

They also beat the driver, Ajay Kumar Chandra, up and snatched Tk 20,000 and a cellphone from him.

Samiul Islam, sub-inspector of Natore Jalmalia highway range, said a group of 8-9 miscreants forced the truck to stop by putting up logs on the road. They then dragged the driver out and beat him up, before robbing him of his possessions and setting the truck on fire.

On information, fire fighters rushed to the spot and doused the fire, but the water sprayed damaged the cement.

The driver, hailing from Mohanpur upazila of Rajshahi, was taken to a local hospital.
