BB heist due to past impunity: BNP
The Bangladesh Bank's money was stolen, thanks to the government’s inaction over embezzlement of bank funds in the recent past, the BNP said on Monday.



The party's joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi made the allegation at a press conference at BNP’s Naya Paltan office.



“The central bank reserve money was pilfered as the government did not take any action against embezzlements in the cases of BASIC Bank, Bismillah Group, state-owned banks and the share market,” Rizvi pointed out.



The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader alleged that high profile persons are involved in the Bangladesh Bank heist. "Attempts were made to cover up the incident," he added.



He demanded punishment of the perpetrators, who were involved in the $100 million heist in February.



Rizvi also urged the authorities concerned to necessary steps for recovering the pilfered money.
