PM for strengthening OIC
Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has called for strengthening Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to settle the problems of Muslim Ummah through dialogue.

"Strengthening of OIC is crucial so that the outsiders get no scope to take advantage," she said when newly appointed ambassador of Saudi Arabia in Bangladesh Abdullah HM Al-Mutairi called on her at her Tejgaon office.

The premier’s press secretary Ihsanul Karim said she congratulated the new ambassador and assured him of extending all cooperation in discharging his duties in Bangladesh.

Sheikh Hasina said relations between Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia are historic.

Now around two mission Bangladeshis are working in Saudi Arabia making contribution to the economy of that country.

Sheikh Hasina denounced the the recent terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia saying that no true Muslim could support such terrorist acts.

"Terrorism is the religion of the terrorist," the prime minister said posing question: “How can Muslim kill another Muslim?”.

The Saudi envoy said the Saudi king values the special relation of his country with Bangladesh. The relation would be stronger in the coming days, he hoped.

The envoy informed the prime minister that about 6 million Muslims would be able to perform hajj every year after completion of the construction work of Makkah.

Pointing out the recent bomb attacks in Saudi mosques he said the people of Saudi Arabia are against the acts in the name of religion.

"There is no scope of bomb attack in Islam and we have a strong community against this type of terrorist act," he said.

The ambassador said he would work to consolidate relation of his country with Bangladesh during his stay in Dhaka.

The prime minister’s principal secretary Abul Kalam Azad and senior officials of the Saudi embassy in Dhaka were present.
