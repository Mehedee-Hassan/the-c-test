Court orders to start case against Jasmine, Tanvir
A Dhaka court on Wednesday gave the go-ahead to start the Sonali Bank scam case against Hall-Mark group chairman Jasmine Islam and managing director Tanvir Mahmud.

Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge Kamrul Hossain Molla passed the order and a bench official of the court, Foyez Ahmed, confirmed the passage of the order to the Prothom Alo.

Foyez said the court on Wednesday framed charges against Jasmine Islam and Tanvir Mahmud and other accused in two cases in connection with the group’s Sonali Bank loan scam and Jasmine’s failure to submit a wealth statement.

The court has fixed 3 March for the deposition in the two cases.

Besides, the court is scheduled to give an order on 3 March on framing charges for nine other cases in Hall-Mark’s Sonali Bank loan scam, according to the bench official.

A Bangladesh Bank investigation revealed that the Ruposhi Bangla Hotel branch of Sonali Bank had lent Hall-Mark Group and five other companies Tk 3,606.48 crore between 2010 and May 2012 on fake documents.

Hall-Mark Group and the five other companies in collusion with some corrupt Sonali Bank’s officials swindled the entire amount belonging to depositors.
