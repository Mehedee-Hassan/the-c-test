SB official, two of Hall-Mark jailed for loan forgery
A high official of state-owned Sonali Bank and two from Hall-Mark Group have been sentenced to suffer life-term in jail in a much-talked about loan forgery case.



A Dhaka court on Tuesday delivered the verdict in the case on embezzlement of Tk 22.2 million.



The three convicts are Saiful Hassan (54), former assistant general manager of Sonali Bank’s Ruposhi Bangla Branch; and Saiful Islam, managing director, and director Abdullah Al Mamun, at Paragon Knit Composite Ltd, a sister concern of Hall-Mark Group.



The judge of special judge of Dhaka, Akhtaruzzaman, delivered the verdict.



All the convicts remain absconding, however. Warrant for arrest of them has been issued in the meantime.



This is the first verdict of the cases related to swindling of more than Tk 4,000 crore from Sonali Bank’s Sheraton (Rupashi Bangla) branch allegedly committed by the Hall-Mark Group. The case was filed in 2013.



Paragon Knit Composite Ltd is one of the five organisations that have been named in the cases.
