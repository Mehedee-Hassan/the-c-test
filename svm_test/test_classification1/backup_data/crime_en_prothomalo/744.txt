Make Bangabandhu universal figure: Ashraf
Ruling Awami League general secretary and public administration minister Syed Ashraful Islam on Thursday called on his party workers to make Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman universal figure.

He also asked the party workers not to keep Bangabandhu within a partisan boundary or within a certain coterie.

Addressing a discussion meeting marking the National Mourning Day, the senior AL leader said the main theme of this year’s National Mourning Day was making Bangabandhu universal.

He said, “Bangabandhu is a political party. He is the father of the nation. Why would he be within a certain coterie? He is in the hearts of millions of Bangladeshis.”

Syed Ashraful Islam said, “The main slogan of this year’s National Mourning Day was to universalise Bangabandhu. We want to see people irrespective of political parties and opinions will place wreaths at the portrait of Bangabandhu with respect. And, this will be Bangabandhu’s win.”

Syed Ashraf also recalled his memories with Sheikh Kamal, elder son of Bangabandhu at the programme.

AL joint general secretary Mahbub-ul-Alam Hanif claimed that BNP founder Ziaur Rahman was involved in the assassination of Bangabandhu.

“The trial of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman murder case will not be complete unless Zia is awarded with posthumous punishment for killing Bangabandhu,” Hanif said.
