TIB serving interest of vested quarters: ACC boss
Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) is serving the interest of some vested quarters, alleged Anti-Corruption Commission acting chairman Shahbuddin on Tuesday.

He was speaking at a discussion at the Shilpakala Academy, organised to mark International Ant-Corruption Day.

Slating the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of TI that ranked Bangladesh as the 14th most corrupt nation in the world, the ACC boss said the anti-graft body rejects the 'baseless' index.

Addressing TIB, the ACC chief said, "We consider you as our friend. You played a significant role in establishing the ACC. We are not ungrateful. But we have the right to protest when we are being blamed unnecessarily."

Law Commission chairman ABM Khairul Haq was the chief guest at the discussion.
