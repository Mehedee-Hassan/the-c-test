Khaleda calls for anti-terrorism national unity
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Khaleda Zia on Sunday expressed apprehensions that the recent militant attacks might leave devastating and far-reaching impacts for the country.

“None of the nation’s achievements will sustain if we fail to contain terrorism. So, we need to forge an anti-terrorism national unity irrespective of political identities without any further delay,” said Khaleda while addressing a media briefing at her Gulshan office.

Khaleda was briefing newsmen in the wake of Friday’s terrorist attack at a restaurant in capital’s diplomatic zone of Gulshan that left at least 28 people killed.

A former prime minister, Khaleda also issued a warning that the authorities should not use terrorist attacks as a means to gag the opposition.
