Pakistan refutes diplomat’s militancy link
Pakistan on Wednesday strongly condemned and protested at the reports in Bangladesh media on alleged involvement of one of its diplomats in militancy.

“The Pakistan High Commission strongly condemns the utterly baseless media reports appearing in the local press, maligning a female diplomat stationed in Dhaka,” read a High Commission press release.

“It has been learnt that,” the press release said, “the ‘story’ was leaked to the press by the Detective Branch of the police, and a section of the press published the same, without any verification worth the name.”

Pakistan HC also alleged that all diplomatic norms and courtesies have been thrown to the wind by publishing “fabricated details of an imaginary ‘sinister plot’ to destabilise the host country.”

“To our utter shock and dismay, the photograph of the said officer has also been recklessly published by the media, and vulgar insinuations have been made regarding her character,” said the HC.

It said it is not only a “despicable” attempt at character assassination but also endangers the security of the officer.

“This is the last thing that is expected to happen in a brotherly, Muslim country.”

The HC said Pakistan would like to reiterate the fact that a strong and prosperous Bangladesh can only add to Pakistan's strength, rather than in any way, diminish it.
