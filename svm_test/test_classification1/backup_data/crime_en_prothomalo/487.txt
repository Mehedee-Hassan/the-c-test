Parliament declares 25 March Genocide Day
The Jatiya Sangsad (national parliament) has passed a resolution declaring 25 March as Genocide Day, marking the start of atrocities unleashed by the Pakistani occupation forces on the people of then-East Pakistan on the date in 1971.

The resolution was passed unanimously in voice vote with speaker Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury in the chair on Saturday.

Earlier in the afternoon, a motion was placed in the parliament to declare March 25 as Genocide Day.

Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Jasad) MP Shirin Akter on Saturday placed the motion in the House.

Bangladesh will observe 25 March as Genocide Day from now onwards.

UNB adds: after the placement of the proposal, prime minister Sheikh Hasina took the floor and showed many videos and images depicting the atrocities of the Pakistani occupation forces on the Bangalees on the fateful night of 25 March in 1971.
