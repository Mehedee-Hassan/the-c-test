About the outcome of the two meetings, Asaduzzaman said the issue of terrorism and counter-terrorism came up for discussions. “We told them that our people don’t like extremism. That’s why we could control terrorism here. We also apprised them how we’re tackling counter-terrorism.”



The US delegations were also informed about the newly formed Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime unit of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) and Cyber Crime unit to face cyber-related crimes, he said.



Asaduzzaman also said they requested the visiting US teams to share information on counter-terrorism as they have expertise in this regard. “Besides, we told them that if they offer us training on counter-terrorism, we’ll welcome them,” he added.



On human rights issue, the home boss said, they told the US teams that policing activities are done protecting human rights.

They also informed the meetings that they were sending illegal migrants to their respective countries, he said.



“They wanted to send back some 30 Bangladeshi illegal migrants who failed to prove their legality,” the home minister said, adding that they told the US teams that the government wants to get sure first that they are Bangladeshi nationals.
