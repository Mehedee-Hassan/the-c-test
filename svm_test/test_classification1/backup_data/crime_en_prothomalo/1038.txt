Cricketer Rubel lands in jail
A Dhaka court on Thursday sent national cricketer Rubel Hossain, a member of the World Cup 2015 squad, to jail in a rape case.



The court passed the order when Rubel appeared before it and sought an anticipatory bail.



On 13 December last year, film actress Naznin Akter Happy filed a case accusing Rubel of rape under the woman and child repression prevention act.



The cricketer took bail from a High Court bench of the Supreme Court on 15 December.

However, as Rubel appeared before the court of Metropolitan Magistrate Anwar Sadat on Thursday, he was sent to jail.

On Monday, Happy filed a petition with the High Court seeking removal of the pacer from the 15-member World Cup squad, but the court rejected her plea.
