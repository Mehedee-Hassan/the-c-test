Twaki Mancha demands Azmeri Osman's arrest
Santrash Nirmul Twaki Mancha, a platform of socio-cultural-political activists protesting at the murder of Tanvir Muhammad Twaki of Narayanganj, demanded arrest of Ajmeri Osman, son of late Jatiya Party leader Nasim Osman, in the murder case.



It also warned the 'conspirators' not to bury the murder case by making a new 'Joj mia' story. One Joj Mia was made the prime accused in the 21 August grenade blast case allegedly to hide the real culprits.



A press release was issued by Santrash Nirmul Twaki Mancha on Sunday signed by the member secretary of the organisation Halim Azad.

"We are deeply concerned about proper investigation of the murder as some newspapers are helping the Osman family in making a smoke screen by publishing false news to save some of their family members who were involved in the incident," said the press release.

"It is clear that they are trying to establish their old statements after two years of the incident through making a 'Joj Mia drama' as some newspapers are publishing false news recently," the press release added.

The press release contradicted some recent comments of the Osman family which claimed that law enforcing agencies found inconsistency in the investigation of Twaki murder.

"Which (new) law enforcing agency is investigating the murder case?" the Mancha wanted to know, caliming that there is no chance of any other agency to do so because the High Court ordered only the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) to investigate the case.

They also said that no further information was given regarding the case after RAB in their investigation report said 11 people, led by Ajmeri Osman, were involved in Twaki murder.
