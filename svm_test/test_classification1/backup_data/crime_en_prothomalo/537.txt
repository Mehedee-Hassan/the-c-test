Delwar released on bail in fraud case
Delwar Hossain, owner of Tazreen Fashions, was released on bail in a fraud case on Monday after one day of his imprisonment.

Chittagong Metropolitan magistrate, Syed Masfiqul Islam, granted the bail after hearing.

On Sunday, a Chittagong court sent Delwar to jail in the fraud case.

Zafar Iqbal, defendant's lawyer, said a cheque had been given to the plaintiff to pay back their money.

He also said the court granted bail after hearing as the plaintiff did not filed any petition against the bail.

The plaintiff's lawyer said though the accused was released on bail but the case would be continued until the whole money repaid.

According to the court sources, Delwar brought accessories worth over Tk 4.4 million from KDS Group Accessories Limited from 2010 to 2011.

The sources added that as the Tazreen owner did not pay the outstanding money, Shimul Sen on behalf of KDS Group filed the fraud case under the section of 406 and 420 on 22 November last year.
