Zia involved in Bangabandhu murder: Tofail
Commerce minister Tofail Ahmed has claimed that BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman was involved in the assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

Tofail, also ruling Awami League advisery council member, came up with the comment on Sunday while talking to journalists after placing wreaths at the portrait of Bangabandhu at Dhanmondi marking the Homecoming Day of prime minister Sheikh Hasina.

"Ziaur Rahman had complicity in the assassination of Bangabandhu. His wife (Khaleda Zia) patronised several of those who opposed the birth of Bangladesh by making them her ministers," Tofail told the newsmen.

About the BNP chief, Tofail said she had failed to foil the 2014 general election boycotting it.

She (Khaleda) even failed to direct the country in course of violence, irregularity and anomaly during BNP's three-month movement, the veteran AL leader added.
