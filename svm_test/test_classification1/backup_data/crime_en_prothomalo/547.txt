NCC Bank official held for embezzling Tk 8.98cr
Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) members arrested an assistant officer of NCC Bank from the city’s Kamalapur area early Thursday on charge of misappropriating Tk 8.98 crore through forgery.

The arrestee was identified as Md Siddiqur Rahman, 32, son of late Masum Miah.

Acting on a tip-off, a team of RAB-3 conducted a drive in front of the ICD gate at Kamalapur around 12:20 am and arrested Siddiqur.

Sources at the RAB headquarters said Siddiqur joined the Remittance-NRB Division of National Commerce and Credit Bank as a data operator on August 2, 2009. Later, he was promoted to assistant officer.

During the period, Siddiqur transferred Tk 8.98 crore to his account through data input illegally. He showed the exchange rate of foreign currency high and transferred the additional money to the account through electronic fund transfer.

The incident came to the notice of the bank authorities in June this year and it was also detected in the audit of Bangladesh Bank.

The bank management filed a case in this regard and also lodged a complaint with the director general of RAB.

Following the allegation, the elite force started investigation and finally arrested the culprit.
