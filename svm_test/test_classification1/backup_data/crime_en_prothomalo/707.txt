Govt trying to use militancy issue for political gain: Fakhrul


BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Friday alleged that the government wants to use the militancy issue to make its political gain and suppress its opponents instead of eliminating the menace.



"Militancy, a dangerous demon, is engulfing the country for lack of democracy. But, the government wants to use it to subdue its opponents instead of properly tackling it. So, the real offenders remain untouched," he said.



The BNP leader came up with the allegation while talking to reporters after placing wreaths together with the leaders and activists of Jatiyatabadi Swechchhasebak Dal at BNP founder Ziaur Rahman's grave, marking its 36th founding anniversary.



Fakhrul said it has now become clear to people that the government is not willing to get rid of militancy. "Militancy is gradually spreading as they (govt) want to use the issue with a political motive."

He alleged that the government has continued implicating BNP leaders and activist in 'false' cases and arresting them to annihilate its opponents.

"A minister has recently said they won't forge any unity with BNP as they want to eliminate it...it's demonstrated what the condition of democracy now in Bangladesh," the BNP secretary general added.

He came down hard on the ruling party leaders for their remarks that Ziaur Rahman had involvement in Bangabandhu murder, saying the ruling party is narrating fictitious stories only to hide their misdeeds.

"Awami League leaders formed the government after the tragic assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as they were behind the murder. If a proper investigation is carried out into the incident, it'll get exposed that it was the Awami League leaders who were involved in the killing," the BNP leader said.

He claimed Zia had no link to the brutal killing of Bangabandhu as he did not believe in such bad politics.

Asked about the party leaders' resentment over its new executive committee, he said it is quite natural that some party leaders are aggrieved over the committee as it was not possible for the party to accommodate its all deserving and dedicated leaders to the 502-member committee. "Some party posts will be vacated as those leaders holding more than one posts will quit those and we'll replace those with our competent leaders."
