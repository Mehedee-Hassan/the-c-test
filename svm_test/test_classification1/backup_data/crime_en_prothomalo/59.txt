‘People will not accept move to set up domestic EC yet again’
The Bangladesh nationalist Party (BNP) on Tuesday warned that the party as well as the people of the country will not accept any move to set up “domestic Election Commission yet again.”

UNB news agency reported that the party secretary general, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, at a discussion also suggested forming a five-member search committee comprising politicians in consultation with political parties.

“We surely want an election under a fully neutral election-time administration and an independent Election Commission. But we won’t accept any election in the Awami League-style under a domestic Election Commission,” said Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir.

Addressing the government, he further said, “Form a search committee but remember if you constitute the search committee ignoring the public opinion, people won’t accept it.”

The BNP arranged the discussion at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh in the capital, marking the BNP chairperson’s ‘9th jail release day’.

The tenure of the current Kazi Rakibuddin Ahmad-led Election Commission will expire in February next.

Meanwhile, law minister Anisul Huq on 15 September hinted that a search committee will be formed to constitute the new Election Commission.
