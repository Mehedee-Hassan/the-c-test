Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) enquiry officer on Thursday submitted a probe report to the commission on the allegation of illegal wealth accumulation by ruling party lawmaker Aslamul Haque, recommending to relieve him from bribery charges.

An ACC senior official confirmed receiving of the report on Thursday.

He said enquiry officer Sheikh Mesbah Uddin, also ACC deputy director, in his report mentioned that he did not find any illegal wealth of Aslamul and recommended to relieve him from bribery charges.

The ACC in January 2013 launched probes into the allegations of unusual wealth accumulations by seven politicians, including Aslamul Haque, lawmaker for Dhaka-14 constituency.

On 5 March 2013, the anti-corruption body interrogated Aslamul for reportedly amassing wealth illegally.
