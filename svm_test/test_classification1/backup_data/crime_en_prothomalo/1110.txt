BCL leader held over murder incident
The police on Friday detained a local leader of Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), Anisur Rahman, and a woman in connection with death of a youth.

Earlier, police recovered the body of the youth, whose hands and legs were found tied, from a pond in Keraniganj around 10:00am.

The victim is Kamrul Islam, 23.

Victim’s sister Lucky Begum said Kamrul used to live in Abdullahpur Nasipara of Keraniganj. On Wednesday, someone called up Karmrul over phone and he went out. “Since then he did not come back.”

On Thursday morning, his family members filed a general diary (GD) with Dhakkhin Keraniganj Model police station.

Later on Thursday night, the family members of the victim also filed a case against Anisur Rahman and an unidentified woman.

Lucky claimed that Kamrul was killed in connection with a relationship with one woman. “The duo is involved in the murder. We will file a murder case against the two people,” said Lucky.

Dakkhin Keraniganj police inspector (investigation) Siddiqur Rahman told Prothom Alo that Kamrul might have been strangulated to death. “Two people were detained in this connection, but it is not clear yet whether they are involved in the murder.”
