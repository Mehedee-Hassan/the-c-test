Missionary school’s guard stabbed dead
A guard of a missionary school in Dinajpur Sadar was stabbed dead on Wednesday night.

According to locals, Shibu Saren, 48, joined Lutheran Mission School on Wednesday and fell victim of violence inside 24 hours.

“Shibu perhaps noticed a thief entering the school and entangled into a brawl with him. The desperate thief, at one stage, stabbed him and fled,” said Mahbub Ahmed, a trader who lives near the school.

Upon hearing his screaming, local people rushed the spot and took Shibu to Dinajpur Medical College Hospital. He died of injuries there.

Kotwali police station officer-in-charge Redwanur Rahim confirmed the incident and said they are investigating the case.
