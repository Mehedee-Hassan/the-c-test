Univ teacher arrested for sexual assault on 2-day remand
A Dhaka court on Wednesday put Mahfuzur Rashid Ferdous, a teacher of Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST), on a 2-day remand in a case filed over sexually harassing two female students of the university.

Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Delwar Hossain passed the order when Kolabagna police station sub inspector Md Shamim Ahmed, also investigation officer of the case, produced him before the court seeking a 7-day remand for him.

The court also rejected a bail petition submitted by Mahfuzur’s lawyer.

A team of Kalabagan police station arrested Mahfuzur Rashid Ferdous, associate professor of the electrical and electronic engineering (EEE) department, from his flat in Dhaka city’s Eskaton area at about 2:00am on Wednesday.

Asadullah Al Sayem, brother of a victim, filed a case against the teacher with the police station on Tuesday night.

On 30 April, the AUST authorities suspended the teacher in the face of the students’ demand.

Earlier, two complaints were lodged to the head of the EEE department in this regard.
