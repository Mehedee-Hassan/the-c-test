Verdict any day on Netrakona war crimes
The International Crimes Tribunal on Sunday kept pending its verdict to be delivered any day as arguments were closed in the trial of 1971 war crimes allegedly perpetrated by two men of Netrakona.

The two accused war criminals are Obaidul Haque Taher and Ataur Rahman Noni.

Hearing the law point arguments from both the prosecution and the defence lawyers, the three-member ICT, headed by its chairman Justice Anwarul Haque, passed the order on Sunday in presence of the accused.

Prosecutors Mokhlesur Rahman Badal and Sabina Yeasmin and defence counsels Abdus Subhan Tarafdar and Tanim Islam concluded their parts of arguments on facts.

The accused duo are facing six charges, including those for mass killing, abduction, looting and arson attack, during the 1971 Liberation War.

On January 6, the ICT set January 10 (today) to end the hearing on the charges.
