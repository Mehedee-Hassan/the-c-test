TIB finds graft, irregularities in RMG supply chain
Irregularities and corruption have engulfed the whole supply chain of the Readymade Garment (RMG) sector, says Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) in its latest survey report.

Bribery has become a regular practice to hide lapses in standard of goods, quantity and compliance, said the report revealed at a press conference at its Dhanmondi office on Thursday, said news agency UNB.

TIB identified 16 phases of supply chain where corruption is apparent and needs to be addressed. Factory owners, merchandisers and buyers are involved, it said.

Senior programme manager Shahjada M Akram, assistant programme manager Nazmul Huda Mina of research and policy unit revealed the report, prepared based on information collected from November 2014 to April 2015.

The report said corruption prevails at all the three phases of supply-chain -- work order, production and supply.
