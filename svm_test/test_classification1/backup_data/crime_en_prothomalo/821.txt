Man sentenced to death for killing wife
A Narayanganj court on Monday sentenced a man to death for killing his wife.

Narayanganj Woman and Children Repression Prevention tribunal and district and session judge Mosammat Lutfa Begum passed the order in absentia of the convict Bodiuzzaman alias Badshah.

During the trial, it was revealed that Badshah used to torture his wife Jannatul Islam for dowry since their marriage in 2008.

Later, the family of the Jannatul paid Badhsha Tk 4 lakh as dowry.

On 25 January 2010, Jannatul was again tortured.

Joynal Abedin, father of the deceased, filed a case with Narayanganj police.
