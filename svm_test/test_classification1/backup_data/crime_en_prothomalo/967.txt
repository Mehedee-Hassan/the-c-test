‘They will kill us if police open fire’
“They [gunmen] will kill us if police open fire on them,” a terrified Hasnat Karim told his uncle Anwarul Karim over phone on Friday night.



Anwarul claimed his nephew Hasnat Karim has been taken hostage with his wife and two children by a group of 10 gunmen inside the Holey Artisan Bakery restaurant in Gulshan.



“Hasnat phoned me first at 10:35pm but couldn’t talk much. At 10:41pm, he called me again saying they [gunmen] are keeping us hostage. If there are police around you, tell them not to open fire on them [gunmen],” said Anwarul.



“They [gunmen] will kill us if police open fire on them,” Hasnat who is an engineer by profession was quoted as saying by Anwarul.



Hasnat could not be contacted over phone after 11:00pm, he added.



Two police officers have so far been killed and over 50 injured as hostage situation is continuing in Gulshan.



Nearly 60 people, including foreign nationals, have reportedly been kept hostage inside the Gulshan restaurant.
