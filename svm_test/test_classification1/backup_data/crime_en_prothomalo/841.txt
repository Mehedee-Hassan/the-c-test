Ministry wants CCC mayor to explain his bribe remark
The Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development (LGRD) and Cooperatives has sought explanation from Chittagong City Corporation (CCC) mayor AJM Nasir Uddin over his comments that the ministry officials seek bribe for allocating funds for his city corporation.

The ministry sent a letter, signed by LGRD and cooperatives additional secretary Jyotirmoy Datta, to the CCC mayor on Thursday.

The letter says, “Various newspapers carried reports on Thursday about your statement at a programme at the Chittagong Theatre Institute auditorium on 10 August citing that senior officials of the ministry seek bribe for project approval and fund allocation… a joint secretary-level official of the ministry demanded a Pajero jeep from you as bribe.”

It further said, “You also mentioned that if you had given five percent commission of the fund allocated for the corporation, you would have got Tk 300 crore instead of the Tk 80 crore.”

The letter also says it is necessary to prove the allegations as the image of the ministry and the government has got tarnished by the statement.

The ministry urged the CCC mayor to submit his explanation before it within seven days.

While talking to reporters earlier in the day after a meeting at the Secretariat, LGRD and cooperatives minister Khandker Mosharraf Hossain said, “I’ll investigate the matter. If the allegation of the Chittagong mayor is found true, it’s very serious. I’ll take action against the officials who demanded the commission.”
