Terrorist hideout also used as training centre
Intelligence officials on Saturday claimed that the terrorist hideout in Mirpur was also used as a training centre for the terrorists.

At least 10 terrorists were trained in bomb making at the hideout, claimed police.

Earlier on Thursday, police claimed that they had detained seven “militants” in a 14-hour raid at an alleged terrorist den in Mirpur.

The law enforcement agency also claimed three of the detainees were members of the banned militant outfit, Jamaat-ul-Mojahideen Bangladesh (JMB), while the rest were also involved in militancy.

A large number of grenades and other explosives were seized from the spot, said Detective Branch (DB) officials.

The DB filed a case with Shah Ali police station on Friday under the Anti-Terrorism Act in connection with Thursday’s recovery of explosives.

Three militant suspects have been taken on a six-day remand for interrogation by the DB of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP).

Additional deputy commissioner (ADC) of DB’s bomb disposal and defusing team Sanowar Hossain said the terrorists in primary interrogation admitted that the hideout was used as a training centre and grenades and other explosives in recent militant activities were supplied from the hideout.

Officials also stated the arrested militants of the

Chittagong shrine incident said they received their training at a six-storey building in Mirpur area.

The owner of the building Abul Hossain Bhuiyan denied knowing anything about his tenants as they took rent as students and he just saw them to leave or arrive with their bags.

Officer in-charge of Shah Ali police station Shahin Mandal said they had distributed the tenant information form to this house also but it was not duly filled out and returned.
