Sagar-Runi murder trial must be held: Minister
Home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal on Wednesday reiterated that the killers of journalist couple Sagar Sarowar and Meherun Runi must be tried, according to UNB news agency.



“Rapid Action Battalion is investigating the murder and it’ll be known after the investigation who had been involved in the murder. Legal action will be taken against those found involved,” he said.



The minister was addressing the monthly meeting on the law and order at the deputy commissioner’s office at noon.



Meherun Runi, senior reporter of private TV channel ATN Bangla, and her husband Sagar Sarowar, news editor of another TV station Maasranga, were murdered in the bedroom at their West Rajabazar apartment on 11 February 2012.



Although four years have elapsed since the incident, there is still no breakthrough in the murder.



Noting that no one is above the law be he is a member of police, BGB, Rab or any influential one, Kamal said if any policeman does any misdeed he will be brought to justice. “The Prime Minister has also shown zero tolerance in this regard.”



Presided over by deputy commissioner Abdur Rahim, the meeting was attended by organising secretary of Central Awami League Abu Syed Al Mahmud Swapan MP and Rajshahi Range DIG Iqbal Bahar.
