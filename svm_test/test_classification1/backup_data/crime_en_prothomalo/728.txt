Tajuddin’s 90th birth anniversary today
The 90th birth anniversary of national leader Tajuddin Ahmed, one of the most influential figures in the history of Bangladesh, is being observed countrywide on Thursday.

Tajuddin Ahmed, the first prime minister of independent Bangladesh , was born on 23 July 1925 in Dardaria village under Kapasia police station of Gazipur. Starting from his younger years, he actively stepped into the leadership role in all the national movements, including the historic Language Movement in 1952 and the War of Liberation of 1971.

During the difficult first phase of the liberation war of 1971, Tajuddin formed the first Government of Bangladesh, and took the responsibility of the prime minister. As the first prime minister, he was instrumental in organizing a guerrilla uprising of Bengali civilians and armed forces as well as winning international support in absence of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

After the liberation war, Tajuddin stepped down from the post of PM once Bangabandhu returned to Bangladesh. He took charge of the ministries of finance and planning, but resigned from the cabinet on 26 October, 1974 due to some ideological and political differences with Sheikh Mujib.

After the assassination of Bangabandhu and most of his family members on 15 August, 1975, Tajuddin was placed under house arrest. Later, he was imprisoned in Dhaka Central Jail along with three other influential leaders - Syed Nazrul Islam, AHM Qamaruzzaman and Muhammad Mansur Ali.

On 3 November of the same year, all four imprisoned leaders including Tajuddin were brutally assassinated at midnight by a group of army officers.

Gazipur District Awami League and its associate bodies have chalked out an elaborate programme in observance of birth anniversary of the great leader.
