Tarana imposes ban on gifts


Newly appointed state minister for post and telecommunications, Tarana Halim, on Thursday said no gifts for her will be entertained.

Flowers can be brought, but people outside the government should not go to her residence with flowers, she warned.

Tarana was speaking at a view exchange meeting at the ministry two days after taking oath.

The new state minister said she is not related to any kind of bribery and asked her subordinates to take care that no one takes undue advantage of her name. She also suggested that people trying to do so should be handed over to police.

Saying that strong actions should be taken against illegal VOIP businesses, she urged everyone to remain alert about it.

Tarana also asked the ministry officials to submit a 90-day work plan after the Eid vacations.

“No one will be pardoned if found involved in corruption. I want to say this ministry is successful, dedicated, and honest,” she added.
