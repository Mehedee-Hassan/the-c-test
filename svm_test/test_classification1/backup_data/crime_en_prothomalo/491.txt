The man behind embezzlement of Tk 6b
Abdul Hye Bachchu, former chairman of state-owned BASIC Bank, alone gave the decision for disbursement of loans worth Tk 6 billion (Tk 600 crore) through fraudulent means.

Investigations found there was recommendation from the scrutiny committee in favour of the approval for these loan proposals. In some cases, proposals were already rejected by such a committee at the head office of the bank.

Even then, Bachchu singlehandedly endorsed those loan proposals at the meetings of the board of directors and sometimes at his verbal directives.

The loans proposals that were endorsed during 2012-13 had an aggregate involvement of Tk 575 crore. He played active role in rescheduling another Tk 25 crore.

All these documentary evidences are available with the BASIC Bank. But the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) could not find out such documents.

The anti-corruption watchdog has completed its investigation but did not find any evidence of involvement of Bachahu in the loan scam.

Those who disbursed loans at the directives of a politically influential Bachchu are being implicated whereas the ‘mastermind’ is set to be exonerated from the charges.

Executive director of Transparency International Bangladesh Iftekharuzzaman said the former chairman could in no way avoid his responsibility in the loan fraud.

The international anti-corruption watchdog’s Bangladesh chapter boss expressed suspicion that if the ACC clears him of charges, it would mean, that is being done following pressure from powerful quarters.

ACC commission (investigation) Nasir Uddin Ahmed told Prothom Alo that the commission would take the matter into serious cognizance for the sake of proper investigation if relevant documents on corruption and his involvement are available.
