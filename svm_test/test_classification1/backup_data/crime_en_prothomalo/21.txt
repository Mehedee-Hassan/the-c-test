Basic Bank scam: SC stays Tajuddin’s bail
The Supreme Court on Sunday stayed a High Court order that had granted interim bail to Ahmed Tajuddin, chairman of M/S UK Bangla Limited, in a case filed over the Basic Bank loan scam.

Appellate Division chamber judge Justice Syed Mahmud Hossain passed the order following a petition filed by the Anti Corruption Commission (ACC).

Barrister Shafique Ahmed stood for Ahmed Tajuddin while Khurshid Alam Khan represented the ACC.

Talking to UNB, Khurshid Alam Khan said the chamber judge stayed the HC order and sent the petition to the regular bench of the Supreme Court fixing 10 November for the next hearing.

On 26 September, the HC granted a four-week interim bail to Ahmed Tajuddin in the case.

The HC also asked the M/S UK Bangla Limited Chairman to submit Tk 20 million to the bank concerned in two equal monthly installments.

Later, the ACC filed a petition to the chamber judge of the SC seeking a stay on the HC order.

A total of 56 cases have been filed in connection with the Basic Bank Loan scam with Gulshan, Motijheel and Paltan police stations on 21, 22, and 23 September in 2015.

Of them, the ACC filed a case against Tajuddin with Gulshan Police Station on September 21, 2015 on charges of embezzlement and defaulting on Tk 456 million loan.
