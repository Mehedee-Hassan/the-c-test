SC stays HC order for MP's surrender
The Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday stayed the High Court order that directed MP Manjurul Islam Liton to surrender before a lower court by October 18 in a case in connection with shooting a minor boy.

On Tuesday, the government filed a petition with the SC seeking stay on the HC order.

SC Chamber Judge Sayed Mahmud Hossain passed the order after hearing the petition.

Attorney General Mahbubey Alam told the reporters that there is no legal bar to arrest the Awami League MP of Gaibandha-1 constituency following the order.

On Monday, the HC rejected the bail petition filed by Liton and asked him to surrender before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court of Gaibandha by October 18.

On October 2, minor boy Sourav, 8, son of Sazu Miah of Gopalcharan village, was injured in his both legs with bullets allegedly fired by Manjurul Islam Liton, MP, at the village in Sundarganj upazila of Rangpur.

A case was filed against Liton the following day by Sazu Miah for attempting to kill his son.

Liton has remained ‘on the run’ since the incident.

On October 8, another case was filed against Liton on charge of vandalism and looting.

Besides, the licences of two firearms of the lawmaker were revoked.
