We apologize to all women: NHRC chief
The National Human Rights Commission chairman Mizanur Rahman on Monday said the perpetrators behind the sexual assault on women during Baishakh celebration at Dhaka University should be brought to book immediately.

"The commission is appalled and shocked by the Pahela Baishakh incident. We apologize to all women of the country. The incident on Pahela Baishakh reveals that brutality and indecency have engulfed us. The perpetrators behind this incident are despicable and pervert people," said the NHRC chief.

He blamed it on the patriarchal mindset and religious bigotry, saying those who believe Pahela Baishakh celebration conflicts with Islam, plagued by patriarchal ideology and cannot accept women's free movement, are involved with the sexual assault.

Castigating the role of the law enforcing agencies, he said, "Police showed laxity to arrest the attackers. However, they have to start working on the incident after the demonstration against the sexual assault broke out."

"The media should keep publishing news regarding this incident so that it does not fade into oblivion," he added.

Criticising the mayor candidates for their silence in this regard, he said, "We are alarmed that the mayoral aspirants haven't uttered a word about the incident. We want their commitment to eliminate sexual violence."

Mizanur Rahman was speaking at a press conference in the National Human Rights Commission office in the capital.

Among others, full time member of the commission Riazul Haque, members of the commission Mahfuza Khanam and Aroma Dutta also spoke.
