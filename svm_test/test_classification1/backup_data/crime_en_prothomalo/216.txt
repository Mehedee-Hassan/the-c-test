'BNP digs its own grave'
Health minister and ruling Awami League (AL) presidium member Mohammed Nasim on Tuesday said Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has dug its own grave by “resorting to politics of killing, making the people hostage.”

“The BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami were conspiring to hold back country’s economic growth and development through vandalism,” Nasim said while addressing a rally at Kazipur in Sirajganj after laying foundation stone of a guest house there.

“But,” he said, “the people of Bangladesh has resisted their conspiracy. Their leaders and activists, including BNP leaders Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman were thrown onto the ash heap of history.”

The AL leader said a four-lane road would be constructed from Bangabandhu Bridge to Fulchhari of Gaibandha on the western bank of Jamuna river.

He said the four-lane road would be constructed with World Bank fund as a measure for river training also which would eventually help reduce distance between Dhaka and different northern districts.
