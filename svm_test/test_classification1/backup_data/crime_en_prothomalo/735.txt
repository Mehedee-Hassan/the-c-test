Russia’s Dhaka mission condemns murder of ambassador in Turkey
The Russian embassy in Dhaka on Tuesday expressed shock at the tragic death in a terrorist attack of ambassador to Turkey Andrey Karlov in Ankara on 19 December 2016.

“All of us are deeply shocked by the assassination and extend condolences to his family and friends,” the embassy said in a press statement.

Russia condemned this inhumane crime aiming “to undermine collective efforts to achieve a political settlement in Syria as well as normalisation of relations between Russia and Turkey”.

“This tragic event compels us to make the uncompromising fight against terrorism in all its manifestations ever more active,” read the statement.

A book of condolence will be opened at the Russian embassy in Dhaka at House NE(J) 9, Road 79, Gulshan-2, Dhaka-1212, from 10am to 12pm and from 2pm to 4pm on Wednesday (21 December).
