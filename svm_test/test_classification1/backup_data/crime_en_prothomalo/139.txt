Child imprisoned in a case filed by mother
A 12-year old has been locked behind bars on charges of theft.



However, this time, the child’s reluctant mother filed the case.



The mother said in the court that she filed the case because her child threatened to kill her.



She claimed her child stole her gold jewelleries and sold it on 27 August.



The court deposition read the child was living with his mother at city’s Basabo area after his father remarried. His mother works in a garment actory. Mozammel Haque Pathan, lawyer of the mother sought arrest warrant for the child.



On 7 November, Khilgoan police arrested the child and produced him before the court.



The court ordered to send him in prison.



Later, the children court ordered to send him to juvenile correction centre in Tongi.



He is currently staying in there.



“ My mother filed a false case to put me in jail. I want to be freed,’ said the child while he was produced before Dhaka children court on Thursday.



Mozammel Haque Pathan, lawyer of the mother, told Prothom Alo, “I haven’t met the child. His mother said he is habituated to theft.”



Salma Ali, executive director of Bangladesh Women Lawyers’ Association (BNWLA), told Prothom Alo that BNWLA will provide legal aid to the child and get him bail.



She added, a child cannot be called an accused. They should be called children exposed to criminal activities.
