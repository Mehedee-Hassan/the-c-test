Anti-terrorism committees to have all local representatives: Ashraf
Public administration minister Syed Ashraful Islam on Thursday said all the local public representatives will be included in the anti-terrorism and militancy committees.

The committees, formed by the local administration, will be apolitical, he told reporters while emerging from the annual conference of deputy commissioners (DCs) at the secretariat.

The 4-day DCs’ Conference 2016 ends on Friday.

“They’ll, of course, be included. All the elected representatives of local government bodies—municipality and union parishad - will be included,” the minister said replying a question whether the

BNP-Jamaat men who are now public representatives in the local government bodies will be there in the committees, report UNB news agency.

He said the local representatives must be there in the grassroots anti-terrorism and militancy committees. The committees may be extended to the grassroots levels, if needed, he added.

The DCs are always ready to curb terrorism, Ashraf said.

In reply to another question, he said there is no lack of coordination between the deputy commissioner and Superintendent of

Police (SP) at the district level in maintaining the law and order situation.

Though the SPs are dealing the law and order situation, the DCs are in leadership position, he said.

The minister said the DCs were asked to bring more dynamism in the local administration.
