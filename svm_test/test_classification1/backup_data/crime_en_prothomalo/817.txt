Wife tortured with screwdrivers and pliers for dowry!
A deputy assistant engineer of the Power Development Board allegedly tortured his wife with screwdrivers and pliers for dowry in Kushtia Town.

The victim Tasnuba Reza was undergoing treatment in Kushtia General Hospital. Her husband Lahori Khan is currently stationed at Naogaon PWD office.

Her family alleged that police did not record any case in this connection. Instead, they termed her a “bad girl”. The police, however, rejected these allegations, saying that they did not take legal action since there were negotiations

between the two families.

A student of Kushtia Islamia College, Tasnuba Reza told Prothom Alo that she got married to Lahori one-and-a-half years ago. Since then her husband used to torture her for dowry. Tasnuba often stayed at her parents’ house in Kusthia town’s Amlapara and seldom visited husband in Naogaon.

She was in Naogaon for the last few days when Lahori tortured her with screwdrivers and pliers for money and for using facebook on her mobile.

The victim’s father Sohel Reza said that he gave Tk five lakh to Lahori after marriage and the husband demanded more to buying some land. Lahori tortured his wife as the in-laws refused to pay any more.

Kushtia General Hospital resident surgeon Taposh Kumar Sarker said that she severely injured all over her body.

When contacted, Naogaon police officer in charge Zakirul Islam said that Tasnuba had an extramarital affair. He said there were a few minor injuries on her body when she was brought to the police station by her husband. They went home after negotiations.
