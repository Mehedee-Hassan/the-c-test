40 women allegedly faced police repression
A total of 44 women fell victim of repression by members of the law enfrocement agencies in the country in the past one year, according Bangladesh Mahila Parishad.

Of the women, 40 were tortured and harassed by the police men, said the women's rights group analysing reports published in 10 daily newspapers.

"This number does in no way represent the entire picture. Women are also being harassed and facing repression when they go to police stations to file general diary (GD). Such experience seldom comes to the newspaper," the parishad's general secretary Maleka Banu said.

Based on the parishad's data, Prothom Alo carried out an investigation and found that there are allegations of killing wife, torture relating to claims of dowry, rape and cheating against the members of police.

Allegations of attacks on female protesters at rallies and women of the families of the people accused in criminal cases are also there.

Dwelling on the allegations, state minister for women and children affairs Meher Afroz Chumki said, “The police sometimes commit excesses.” She referred to the police repression on them when they were in the opposition.

The issue of police torture and excesses came to the limelight again on Sunday as the police men attacked female activists of Bagladesh Chhatra Union, who were holding demonstrations protesting harassment of women at Dhaka University campus on Pahela Baishakh (first day of Bangla new year).

On Tuesday, inspector general of police Shahidul Haque termed the Dhaka University incident a trifling matter.

When he was contacted over phone for his comments on the matter, the IGP did not receive the phone call. He sent an SMS saying he was in a meeting.
