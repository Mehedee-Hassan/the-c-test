Violence against children worries UNICEF
UNICEF Bangladesh says it observes with alarm the recent incidents of children being subjected to violence and publicly beaten to death in some parts of the country.

“This is a serious violation of child rights and UNICEF expresses its grave concern over such issues which have shaken the entire country,” UNICEF representative Edouard Beigbeder said in a statement on Thursday.

UNICEF strongly believes the government of Bangladesh “will do everything within its power to bring perpetrators to justice and help to end such violence against children”.

“It is important to note that due to the pervasive and proactive media coverage on child rights issues, incidences of child abuse, beating and even killing are now coming under sharp focus,” said UNICEF, the UN body which works to promote child rights and protect children from violence.

UNICEF Bangladesh also appreciates the responsible role played by the country’s media in reporting such crimes against children.

It feels that the rights of all children, especially those from marginalised groups, will be better protected through the collective effort of all concerned.
