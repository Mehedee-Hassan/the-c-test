SC extends Fakhrul’s bail in 3 vandalism cases
The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on Monday extended till March 15 the bail of BNP acting secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir in three vandalism cases.



A five member bench led by Chief Justice SK Sinha passed the order after the hearing on a leave to appeal petition, filed earlier on February 15 by the lawyers of Mirza Fakhrul, reports news agency UNB.



The court also ordered the BNP leader to surrender before the lower court within 15 days.



Additional attorney general Murad Reza stood for the state in the hearing while Barrister Rafiqul Haque and Joynul Abedin argued for Fakhrul.



Earlier on 24 November, 2015, the High Court granted three months bail to Fakhrul in the three vandalism cases.



Two of the cases were filed with Paltan Police Station while another with Motijheel Police Station.



Meanwhile, the Supreme Court accepted the fresh affidavit explanation of the BNP leader’s recent remarks on the judiciary.



On 25 February, the Supreme Court rejected his earlier submission in this connection and ordered him to submit a fresh one along with newspaper reports by today (Monday).



On 22 February, Mirza Fakhrul submitted an affidavit explanation to the Appellate Division following a Supreme Court order issued earlier.



On acceptance of the explanation in today’s (Monday’s) hearing, the Supreme Court observed that lawyers and politicians ought not to come up with remarks that can disparage the faith of the people on the judiciary.



The Supreme Court also reminded that the judiciary is not part of the government, but of the state.



Earlier on 7 February, speaking at the council of Sylhet city unit and district unit BNP in Sylhet, Fakhrul accused the government of controlling the judiciary.



“All the democratic institutions have been destroyed in a planned way. There’s no democracy in the country and the judiciary is not independent,” he said.
