Miscreants hijack truck hacking businessmen
Miscreants hijacked a truck hacking two businessmen on Mohakhali flyover in the city early Tuesday. Police, later, seized the truck.



The injured Nasir Uddin, 23, and his brother Abdur Rashid, 37, have been undergoing treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital.



They were going to Tangail along with Shafiq, a relative of them. At about 3:00am, some unidentified people halted their truck, loaded with vegetables, on Mahakhali flyover. At one stage, the miscreants hacked the siblings and snatched Tk 60,000 before getting away with the truck.



Ashulia police sub-inspector Abul Kalam said police have already seized the truck and detained one in connection with the incident.
