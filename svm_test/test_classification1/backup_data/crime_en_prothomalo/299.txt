Hasina reiterates 'tough' stance on militancy
Expressing her firm resolve to eliminate militancy, prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday warned that her government would be very tough to stamp out the demon from the country.



"We would be very tough and do whatever is necessary to eliminate militancy...we must combat the manmade disasters along with natural calamities," she said.



The prime minister issued the warning while exchanging Eid greetings with the officials of the prime minister's office and reviewing the projects being implemented under the PMO in Dhaka this morning.

After the meeting, the premier's press secretary Ihsanul Karim briefed reporters.

She said she always banks on the people and is working with their trust. "So, the spirit of the war of liberation could not be destroyed and trial of war criminals could not be stopped by unleashing terrorism and militancy as the people are always against the twin monsters," she said.



Sheikh Hasina also urged the countrymen to keep a sharp vigilance on the militancy and terrorism. "We will also have to make the people aware of militancy and terrorism and take the country forward by facing these social menaces," she said.

The prime minister called upon all to form committees at district, upazila and union levels to resist terrorism and militancy. "Sermon against terrorism and militancy will have to be delivered at the mosques regularly," she said.



Referring to the Gulshan cafe attack, the Premier said such incidents happened even in developing countries as it is now a global problem.



In this connection, she mentioned the names of France, the UK, Belgium, Japan, India and other countries where such attacks were made.
