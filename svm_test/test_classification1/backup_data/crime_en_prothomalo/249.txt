Rizvi denied bail
A Dhaka court on Wednesday rejected both the bail and remand prayers for and against BNP joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi in a case filed with city’s Paltan Police Station on charge of vandalism and obstructing police in performing duties.

Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Mohammad Hasibul Haque passed the order after hearing the petitions for bail and remand.

The court also asked the investigation officer to interrogate Rizvi at the jail gate within three working days.

Mohammad Sanaullah Miah, lawyer of Rizvi, filed the bail petition in the case with the court while the investigation officer sought remand of 10 days for Rizvi in the case.

Masud Munsi, sub-inspector of Paltan police station and investigation officer of the case, on Wednesday produced the BNP leader before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate’s Court.

Police showed him arrested on June 8 in the case for attacking police and vandalism.

Sub-inspector Abdul Malek Hawladar of the police station filed the case against Rizvi and others on December 29 last year.
