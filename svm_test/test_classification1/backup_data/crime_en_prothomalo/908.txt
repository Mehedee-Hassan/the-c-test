Bomb blasts in Lalbagh, youth loses hand
A young man lost his right hand severed from his elbow in a bomb blast at Lalbagh in the capital on Wednesday around 2:30pm.

He was identfied as Bappi, a resident of Dhakeshwari area there.

The blast also left his niece Happy, 12, and nephew Ripon, 6, severely burnt in their faces. The victims have been shifted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital for medication.

The accident took place on the first floor of a five storied building, 31/2 Dhakeswari in Lalbagh. Bappi's sister Jhumur said she knows nothing about it.

Mofiz Uddin Ahmed, deputy commissioner of Lalbagh police, however, said the blast occurred while probably Bappi himself was making the bomb.

The police have seized bomb making materials from the scene.
