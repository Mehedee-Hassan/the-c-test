Seven Oriental Bank officials jailed
Seven high officials of now-defunct Oriental Bank have been sentenced to suffer 10 years in jail for loan fraud.

Dhaka’s special judge’s court-2 on Monday delivered the judgement in the loan scam case.

The convicts are the bank’s the then senior vice president Shah Mohammad Harun, senior assistant vice president Abul Kashem Mahmudullah, vice presidents Fazlur Rahman, Mohammad Tarikul Alam and Mahmud Hossain, executive vice president Quamrul Islam and deputy general manager Emamul Haque.

The Anti-Corruption Commission had in 2006 filed a case relating embezzlement of money, accusing the officials.
