Tk 59 crore to fight corruption
Finance Minister AMA Muhith on Thursday proposed an allocation of Tk 59 crore in fiscal year 2014-15 for work related to checking graft in the country.

The government allocated Tk 38 crore for this in the outgoing fiscal ( 2013-14), that was later revised to Tk 48 crore.

“Combating corruption has always been our priority. We, however, believe that laws alone cannot eliminate corruption from the society. It will require strong political will, social commitment and institutional drive,” Muhith said while placing the budget for the fiscal 2014-15 in parliament.

The finance minister also said the required amendments had been made in the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 and the Commission is now equipped with adequate manpower and logistics to be able to work more efficiently and independently than in the past.

“To raise mass awareness about the evils of corruption, Corruption Prevention Committees have been formed in towns, districts and upazilas comprising respected citizens.”

The Finance Minister said the government is focusing on students and trying to imbue them with the spirit of honesty and morality and therefore has formed 20,886 Honesty Clubs drawing students from all levels of institutions.
