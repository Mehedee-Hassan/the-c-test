Viquarunnisa rape case: Prosecution declares witness hostile
The prosecution on Tuesday declared one of its witnesses hostile halfway through his testimony against Viqarunnisa rape case accused Parimal Joydhar.

During his deposition before a tribunal, Babul Kumar Karmaker, a teacher of Bashundhara branch of Viqarunnisa Noon School and College, said perhaps the Class-X student complained to acting headmaster Lutfur Rahman against Parimal for his indecent behiviour in June 2011 which made the prosecution blood boiled.

At this stage, drawing the court’s attention, prosecutor Mohammad Forkan Miah sought for declaring his witness hostile and allowing him to cross-examine the turncoat witness.

The court allowed the prosecution pleas and Forkan cross-examined Babul.

Meanwhile, two more teachers -- Jagadish Chandra Paul and Jannatul Nesa -- gave their deposition before the tribunal on Tuesday.

Later, Judge of the Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunal-4 Mohammad Arifur Rahman fixed September 14 for next hearing of the case.

With this, a total of 19 witnesses have so far testified before the tribunal in the case.

Parimal sexually assaulted the girl confining her to a room of his house twice in May and June of 2011 and recorded the deplorable acts with his mobile phone.

On July 5, 2011, the victim's father lodged a rape case with Badda Police Station against Parimal, Viqarunnisa principal Hosne Ara and its Bashundhara branch head Lutfur Rahman.

Detectives arrested Parimal from a relative's house in Keraniganj on July 7 of the year. He made a confessional statement before a court on July 11.

Police submitted a charge sheet to the court on August 11 of the year, dropping the names of Hosne Ara and Lutfur Rahman.

The court finally framed charges against Parimal on March 7, 2012.
