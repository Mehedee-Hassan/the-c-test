'Target was any whiteman, not Tavella'
The motive behind killing the Italian aid worker was to kill a 'whiteman, foreigner', not Tavella Cesare in particular.



Dhaka metropolitan police (DMP) commissioner Asaduzzaman Mia claimed this said at a media briefing at the DMP media centre on Monday.



“In the primary interrogation, the suspects said their ‘senior brother’ (mentor) gave them money to kill any white foreigner,” he said.



Four suspects, arrested in connection with the Tavella murder, were produced before the journalists.



They were named as Vagne Russel, Shooter Rubel, Chakti Russel and Sharif. Sharif is said to be the owner of the motorcycle used in the murder incident, and the rest three allegedly took part in the murder.



The DMP commissioner claimed that the motive behind the murder was to put the government under international pressure by displaying that the country is not safe for the foreigners.



“The matter of claiming responsibility of the murder by IS is a drama aimed at hiding the killers. The police are trying to identify the ‘senior brother’, mentioned by the suspects. More information would be revealed when the arrestees will be interrogated,” Asaduzzaman added.
