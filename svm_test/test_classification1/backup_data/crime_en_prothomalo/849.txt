DSCC official caught while taking bribe
The Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) on Thursday caught a tax official of Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) red-handed while he was taking bribe in the capital, reports news agency UNB.

A 10-member ACC team, led by its director Nasim Anwar, arrested DSCC deputy tax officer Tofazzal Hossain Jumadder from the city's Circular Road around 5 am, ACC public relations officer Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya told UNB.

Mustafa Ahammad Ali, a resident of DNCC area, recently went to the city corporation office to submit his holding tax, but Tofazzal Hossain showed him extra tax in his document, and demanded Tk 50,000 in bribe promising to minimise the tax amount.

The victim then submitted a written compliant with the Commission against the DSCC official.

In consultation with the ACC officials, the plaintiff asked Tofazzal to come in front of his Circular Road home on Thursday afternoon to take Tk 20,000 in bribe.

Then the ACC team caught him red-handed.

The ACC team also seized Tk 1.02 lakh from this possession.

ACC assistant director Md Abdul Wahab Alam of its Dhaka Zila office filed a case against him with Kalabagan Police Station in this connection.
