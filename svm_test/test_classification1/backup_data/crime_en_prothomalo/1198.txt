Crime accused warned over polls partcipation
The police on Thursday said they will take legal actions against any crime accused taking part or campaigning in the Dhaka City Corporation polls without having bail from the court.

Dhaka Metropolitan Police spokesperson Monirul Islam, also the joint commissioner of the detective branch, said this to the newsmen.

"The Election Commission will look into the legality of the candidate. But legal actions will be taken under criminal act if any accused without having bails orders take part or campaigns in public during the elections," Manirul Islam said.

Security measures will be taken so that the two city corporation polls become free and people can vote without fear, the officer also said.

He added that the ongoing drive against illegal arms and terrorism will be strengthened in future.
