BNP denounces AL's position on WB
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) denounced the ruling party's recent stance on World Bank (WB) at a press conference held at BNP's central office on Friday.

BNP's senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said a number of ministers and 'irresponsible' Awami League (AL) leaders are rather defaming the WB which may result in serious consequences.

Rizvi said the WB provides Bangladesh with loans at the minimum interest rate (0.5 per cent) while the others provide at 3 per cent or more. Insulting the WB will not bring any good for Bangladesh.

Rizvi criticised AL leaders saying they turned this country into a safe haven for corrupt people, all the sectors in Bangladesh are suffering from corruption and the state-run financial institutions have been undermined.

The BNP leader also expressed his fears that the present government's stance would harm the projects that are running on WB fund.
