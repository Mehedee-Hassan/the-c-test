ACC grills Nasir Group officials
The Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) on Sunday interrogated three general managers of Nasir Group in connection with an allegation of about Tk 61 crore embezzlement.

ACC deputy director Mir Zainul Abedin Shebly questioned them from about 10:00am to 4:00pm at the ACC head office in the capital, ACC public relations officer Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya told UNB.

Nasir Group general managers Alfaz Uddin Ahmed, Shamsul Islam Shamim and Siddiqur Rahman, and deputy general manger Mobaidul Islam were the trio interrogated.

Although Nasir Group chairman Nasir Uddin Biswas was scheduled to be grilled Sunday, he did not turn up at the ACC office on health grounds.

On 8 February, 2015, the national anti-graft body filed a case against 10 people, including Nasir Group chairman, for allegedly siphoning off about Tk 61 crore.

The case was filed against Nasir Group chairman Nasir Uddin Biswas, its general manager (import) Alfaz Uddin Ahmed, general manger (marketing) Shamsul Islam Shamim, general manger (finance and accounts) Siddiqur Rahman, then assistant general manger (procurement) Mobaidul Islam, cash officer Mohammad Shamim, staff of AJ Money exchange Saiful Biswas and M Emdadul, and two others – Adil Ahmed and Firoz Ahmed.

According to the first information report (FIR), all the accused in collusion with each other siphoned off about Tk 61 crore abroad in importing raw materials and goods to the different companies of Nasir Group through under-invoicing and over-invoicing.

The case was filed under the Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002.
