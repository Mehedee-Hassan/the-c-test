Jabbar verdict any day
A tribunal will deliver its verdict any day against fugitive war crimes suspect Abdul Jabbar, a former Jatiya Party parliamentarian, for his alleged crimes against humanity during the liberation war.



Closing the summing-up arguments from both sides, the International Crimes Tribunal-1 (ICT-1) led by justice M Enayetur Rahim kept the verdict waiting today.



Jabbar, who was chairman of Mathbaria Peace Committee in Pirojpur in 1971, is facing five charges, including murder, mass killing, looting and forced conversion for his wartime offences.
