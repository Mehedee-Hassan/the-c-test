22 held for biometric SIM forgery
Police arrested 22 people, including several officials of a mobile phone operator, from different parts of the city on Tuesday night for selling SIM cards after fraudulently registering those in others’ names in the biometric process.

Tipped off, police conducted drives in Karwanbazar, Farmegate, Tejturibazar, Tejkunipara and Indira Road areas and arrested them.

Biplab Kumar Sarkar, deputy commissioner (Tejgaon Division) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, said the arrests were made following allegations lodged by Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission and the mobile phone operator concerned.

He said the fraudsters took the fingerprints of several people and registered a number of SIM cards against their names and sold those in markets.
