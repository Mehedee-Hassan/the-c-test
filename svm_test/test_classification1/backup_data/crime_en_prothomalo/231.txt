'Speedy Trial extension to keep BNP out of polls'


Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) standing committee member Nazrul Islam Khan on Friday alleged that the government has extended the Speedy Trail Act tenure by five years to keep BNP and opposition political parties out of elections and send party men to jail.

Nazrul Islam Khan made the comment while addressing a human chain programme at the National Press Club in Dhaka.

Comilla Jatiyatabadi Samajik Sangskritik Sangstha (Jasas), cultural front of BNP, organised the programme demanding the release of top BNP leaders, including its standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain.

Parliament on Thursday passed the “Law and Order Disruption (Speedy Trial) (Amendment) Bill, 2014” extending by another five years the tenure of the Speedy Trial Act that deals with serious crimes such as extortion, vandalism and tender manipulation.
