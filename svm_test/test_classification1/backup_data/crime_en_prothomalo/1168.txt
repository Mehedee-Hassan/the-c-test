'Cyber law to have provision of 14 yrs’ jail'
Observing that cyber crime is more serious than murder and rape, the law minister, Anisul Huq, said on Sunday there will be provisions of maximum 14 years’ imprisonment in the proposed ‘Digital Security Act-2016’, aiming to tackle the menace.

He revealed this while talking to reporters after a meeting on the draft of the proposed law at the secretariat.

The minister said sections 54, 55, 56 and 57 of the existing ICT Act will be incorporated in the new law.

He also said the minimum punishment for cyber crime will be decided as per its gravity.

Anisul also hoped that concerns over the section 57 of the ICT Act will go once the digital security act is in place.

State minister for information and communication technology Zunaid Ahmed Palak and high officials were present at the meeting.
