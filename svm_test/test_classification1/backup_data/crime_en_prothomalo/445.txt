Dhaka conveys protest at Islamabad’s reaction to Quasem execution
Bangladesh has conveyed its strong protest against Pakistan’s reaction to the execution of Jamaat-e-Islami leader Mir Quasem Ali, the foreign ministry said on Sunday.



Shortly after the execution of Quasem at Kashimpur jail on Saturday night, Pakistan put up a press release on its foreign ministry website, condemning the execution.



Pakistan said Quasem was executed for the “alleged crimes committed before December 1971” and termed the trial as a “flawed judicial process”.



Protesting at the Pakistan’s reaction, the acting high commissioner of Pakistan in Dhaka Samina Mehtab was called on Sunday and a note verbale was handed over to her.



“By repeatedly taking the side of those Bangladesh nationals who are convicted of crimes against humanity and genocide, Pakistan has once again acknowledged its direct involvement and complicity with the mass atrocity crimes committed during Bangladesh’s liberation war in 1971,” read the note verbale.



It also stated that Bangladesh strongly “rejects Pakistan’s claim that these are ‘recriminations for political gains’.”
