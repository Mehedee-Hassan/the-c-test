The child stolen from Dhaka Medical College Hospital has been rescued in Gazipur by Rapid Action Battalion at about 2:30am on Thursday.

The arrestees are Beli Akhter alias Rahima, 45, and Rasheda Khanam alias Parvin, 48.

RAB additional director general (ADG) colonel Ziaul Ahsan told Prothom Alo on Thursday morning that they rescued the child from Bely Akhet alias Rahima in north Kalmeshwar area of Board Bazar at sadar upazila in Gazipur. Rahima took the child from DMCH nursing assistant Parvin in exchange of Tk 40,000.
