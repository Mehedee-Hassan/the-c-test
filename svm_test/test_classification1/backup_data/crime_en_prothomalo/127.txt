The government on Friday declared Lalmonirhat as the country’s first child marriage-free district.

Several thousand people from different classes and professions joined the rally to celebrate the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion, the cabinet secretary said elected public representatives as well as various government and social organisations at district and upazila levels have created the ground for making the district child marriage-free through organising motivation programmes, consultations for children and guardians and administering oaths to marriage registers.

Top officials of the administration were present at the programme.
