DU students block road after police assault
A group of Dhaka University students on Monday blocked Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue at SAARC Foara intersection in the capital’s Karwanbazar in protest against an alleged police assault on some of their fellow students.



The DU students alleged that the police beat them dragging them down from their university bus at the intersection following an altercation over traffic movement. They also alleged the law enforcers took away their cell phones during the altercation.



While talking to this correspondent at the scene of occurrence, policemen, however, denied the allegation.



The students and other witnesses said DU students locked in an altercation with the police officials around 1:30pm when they were trying to get their university bus, Falguni, passed the crossing in defiance of traffic police’s instruction.



Several DU students alleged three to police men and an Ansar member swooped on the students even after the dispute was resolved and beat them up mercilessly dragging them down from the university bus.



The injury mark of assault was evident in the appearance of at least three students.



As some of their fellow DU students joined them later, a group of students, swooped on a constable and the Ansar member sitting in a human-hauler who were rescued by senior officers.



Later, agitating DU students blocked a stretch of Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue halting traffic movement on the busy road for at least half-an-hour.



They withdrew the blockade after senior police officials rushed to the spot and appologised to the students for the misconducts of their colleagues.

Kalabagan police station officer-in-charge, Mohammad Iqbal, who also rushed to the spot told the Prothom Alo that they were investigating into the allegation.
