362 incidents of sexual assault in 2015
Advocate Salma Ali, executive director of Bangladesh Mahila Ainjibi Samity, on Monday said at least 362 incidents of sexual assault were recorded in Bangladesh in 2015, which is 24 per cent higher than the previous year.

“The incidents of blackmailing children and women through pornography are also on the rise as at least 49 cases of pornography were published in media in 2015”, she said at a press conference on ‘Violence on Women and Children in 2015 and Our Duty’ at the National Press Club.

Mentioning that many of the victims of pornography do not take legal protection fearing embarrassment, Salma Ali said as the perpetrators remain untouched, the incidents of sexual assault are on the rise.

New types of sexual harassment are being occurred in recent times while the incidents of fatwa issuance and acid violence have declined, she also said.

The other speakers at the press conference urged the government to establish separate court and special police station to fight violence against women and children.

Advocate Fouzia Karim along with some other leaders of Bangladesh Mahila Ainjibi Samity were also present in the programme.
