Lawman accused of harassing expat
Singair police sub-inspector Alamgir Hossain allegedly harassed Bhagirath Sarker, an expatriate back from Brunei, threatening to file false cases and taking bribe of Tk 25000 on early Friday.

The victim returned from Brunei after three years on Friday. After landing at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, Bhagirath Sarker headed for his village in a private car along with his son Biswajit Sarker and son-in-law Biswajit Mandal.

Ashish Kumar, another son-in-law of Bhagirath, claimed sub-inspector Alamgir Hossain stopped their car when they reached Charigram area in Singair around 12:00am. The officer threatened them of suing for carrying illegal drugs even after they showed all legal documents and passport, he added.

At one stage, Alamgir asked for bribe of Tk one lakh for their release. He took them to the police station, as they did not comply with his proposal, added Ashish Kumar.

Later, after settling a bribe of Tk 25,000, Alamgir Hossian handed them to Manikganj chief judicial magistrate court showing arrested under Act-34. Having granted a bail from the court, the victims finally returned home at afternoon.

However, sub-inspector Alamgir Hossain denied the allegation of taking bribe, saying he stopped the car and interrogated the passengers after hearing loud sound coming from it. They were detained upon giving contradictory information, he added.
