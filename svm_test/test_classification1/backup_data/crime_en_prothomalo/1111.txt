CPJ welcomes Rajib verdict
The New York-based organisation Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has welcomed Thursday's convictions in the murder case of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider.

A Dhaka court on Thursday sentenced two persons to death for Rajib murder, including Rezwanul Azad Rana, a fugitive who was charged in absentia and who was described by police as the mastermind, according to reports.

Six others were convicted over the attack, according to The Associated Press.

"The convictions in the murder of Rajib mark a long overdue but encouraging first step in addressing the violence directed against bloggers in Bangladesh," said CPJ Asia Research Associate Sumit Galhotra.

"However, until the mastermind has been apprehended justice remains incomplete. If prime minister Sheikh Hasina's government is committed to protecting the country's independent voices, it must act decisively to deliver justice in the murders of other bloggers and ensure the protection of those who remain at risk."

A lawyer for the defendants said they would appeal challenging the verdict, reports said.

Haider covered mass protests known as the Shahbagh movement shortly before his murder, reports said.

In 2015, four other bloggers and a publisher were hacked to death, CPJ research shows. To date, there have been no convictions in those cases.
