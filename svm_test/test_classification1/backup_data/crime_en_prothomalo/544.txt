Ragib Ali, son jailed in fraud case
A Sylhet court on Thursday sentenced industrialist Ragib Ali and his son Abdul Hye to one year imprisonment each in a fraud case.

Chief metropolitan magistrate Saifuzzaman Hiro delivered the verdict in presence of Ragib Ali and his son, reports UNB.

The court also fined them Tk 5,000 each and they will have to serve one more month jail term in case of failure to pay the fine.

On 6 March, the same court fixed Wednesday (March 9) for delivering the verdict in the case filed against the industrialist and his son for allegedly holding the editorial posts of local newspaper 'Dainik Sylheter Dak' while being fugitives in a land grabbing case.

On 8 September last year, Giash Uddin Talukder, president of Chhatak Upazila Press Club, filed the case.

Ragib was the publisher and president of the editorial board while his son was its editor but they had fled to India soon after a court issued arrest warrants against them in a forgery case.
