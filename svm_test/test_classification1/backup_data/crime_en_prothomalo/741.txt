Ashraf calls for vigilance against communalism
Ruling Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam on Wednesday urged all to stay vigilant so that no one can breed communalism in the country, reports UNB news agency.

“Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman wanted to build Bangladesh as a non-communal state. But, there had been an attempt to establish Bangladesh as an ultra communal country through the assassination of Bangabandhu,” he said.

Syed Ashraf, also the public administration minister, said this while addressing a discussion marking ‘Kothin Chibor Dan-2015’, a religious festival of the Buddhist community, at Dhammarajika Monastery in the capital's Sabujbagh area.

The present government under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina has been working to establish Bangladesh as a non-communal country, said the minister adding, “A quarter is out there to destroy the country’s existing communal harmony, but they won’t succeed.”
