Bangladesh never denied its rights to water, Tripura governor claims
Visiting governor of Indian state of Tripura Tathagata Roy on Sunday claimed India never denies Bangladesh of its rights to common river water, and hoped that the two countries would be able to resolve the issue, reports UNB news agency.



Tathagata said this when he met prime minister Sheikh Hasina at her office.



PM’s press secretary Ihsanul Karim briefed reporters after the meeting.



He said the governor thanked the prime minister for introducing Dhaka-Agartala bus service and appreciated Bangladesh's progress in various

sectors.



He also praised the prime minister’s leadership and greeted her for the inauguration of the construction work on the Padma Bridge.



The Tripura governor arrived in Bangladesh to inaugurate a memorial in Kushtia in memory of Indian soldiers died during a fight with Pakistan occupation army in 1971.



Turning to power export, Tathagata Roy said Tripura is ready to export electricity to Bangladesh from its Palatona Power plant.



Prime minister Sheikh Hasina recalled the role and support of Tripura government and its people during Bangladesh's War of Liberation.



She said Bangladesh for a long time after the assassination of Bangabandhu walked on wrong track and the rulers had tried to portray wrong history.



But, the Awami League government, after coming to power, allowed people to know the real history and the new generation is very curious to know about the real history of the country.



The prime minister said the proposed Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal road network would strengthen connectivity among the country and open up the door of regional connectivity.



Sheikh Hasina informed the Tripura governor of her government's initiative to establish Rabindra University in Sahjadpur, Sirajganj saying one of its faculties would be set up in Kushtia.
