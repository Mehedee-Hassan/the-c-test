Parliament’s original design being brought back: Mosharraf
Housing and Public Works Minister Mosharraf Hossain on Saturday said the original design of parliament made by American architect Louis I Kahn is being brought back for its full restoration through fixing its manipulated parts.



“We thank our Prime Minister as she has directed us to bring back the original design of the Louis I Kahn. Our chief architect along 5-6 others went to the Pennsylvania University and talked to his (I Khan’s) partner Henry Wilcots. We’ve already paid $65,000 to bring the original design. The design is being sent through FedEx,” he said.



Speaking at a consultation meeting at Ramna Restaurant with experts over the enhancing the beauty of Ramna Park and preserving its heritage and biodiversity, the minister said they will examine the design thoroughly and will restore its original shape, reports news agency UNB.



“If there are places kept aside for grave in it, I would say my grave should be there (after my death). If there’s no such place, no grave will be there. We’re not saying to remove anything, but we’ll restore the original design.”



He also said if the residence of the Speaker, which was built in the area, is found inconsistent with the design it will also not be there.



Mosharraf said Louis I Kahn’s parliament design is recognised as one of the 10 best architectural designs in the world, but it has been manipulated.



He also regretted that the Crescent Lake near Parliament Bhaban has also been stalled distorting the original design. “The present Crescent Lake is not the lake as it was.”



The Housing and Public Works Ministry last year proposed removing eight graves, including BNP founder Ziaur Rahman’s one, and some other establishments, setting up in parliament area distorting the original design of Louis I Kahn.



As per the original design, the Bangladesh Secretariat was supposed to be there at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar.



BNP has been opposing the government’s move to remove Zia’s grave as it thinks there is a ‘political vengeance’ behind it.



After his assassination at Chittagong Circuit House on 30 May, 1981, Ziaur Rahman was primarily buried at Rangunia in Chittagong on the same day, but his body was retrieved from the grave and flown to Dhaka the following day and buried at Chandrima Udyan in the parliament area.
