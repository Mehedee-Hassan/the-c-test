Seventeen people, including Chittagong mayor AJM Nasir, and Feni parliamentarian Nizam Hazari, have been acquitted in an attempt to murder case.

Chittagong district and session judge, Md Nurul Huda, gave the verdict on Wednesday.

Lawyer of the Chittagong district and session judge court, Md Abul Hashem, confirmed this to Prothom Alo.
