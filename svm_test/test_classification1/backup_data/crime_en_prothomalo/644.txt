ACC rejects TI graft index
The Anti-Corruption Commission has rejected the Corruption Perceptions Index 2014 of Transparency International.

The CPI, published on Wednesday, said that Bangladesh is the 14th most corrupt among 174 countries in the world.

'The real scenario is different. ACC does not agree with the CPI findings,' ACC commissioner Shahabuddin told journalists following the publication of the index.

'We are yet to get the full report. Even when we get it, I doubt we would find that making any sense,' said the ACC boss.

'ACC is the most active now in years, which has slashed corruption as well,' claimed Shahabuddin.

The CPI ranked Sudan, North Korea and Somalia as the worst offenders and Denmark, New Zealand and Finland as the most squeaky clean, says AFP.

It pointed to a rise in reports of corruption in Turkey, which suffered the year's biggest fall in rank, and low rankings for the major emerging economies known collectively as the BRICs -- Brazil, Russia, India and China.
