Edn Minister challenges TIB
Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) will have to apologise to public if its report on corruption and bribery in private universities appears false and fabricated, the education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said on Thursday.



He also asked the anti-corruption watchdog to withdraw its report that was unveiled in a programme in Dhaka on Monday.



The minister, while addressing the parliament on a motion raised by the Naogaon 3 lawmaker Salim Uddin, also said the TIB report has no specific complaint and factual information.



Terming the report baseless, the minister said TIB brought out the report to tarnish the image of the government and to distract the people.



Even though, the ministry started investigation to probe the complaints on Thursday, the minister confirmed.



He said, 'TIB has no right to distract people through spreading false information. It should bring out the evidence that supports its allegations. If it fails to do that, it should apologise to the public.'
