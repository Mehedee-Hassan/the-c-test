PM asks BNP to return to democratic path
Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday said the BNP could go to power only under a democratic process, not over the cadavers of innocent people, violence or making the students hostages.

She called upon the BNP to return to democratic process as the party has a dream to go to power again.

"But they cannot go to power over the burned bodied of bus and truck drivers, children and innocent people. They must go under a democratic process," the prime minister said addressing the officials of the religious affairs ministry at the Secretariat.

She went to the ministry as part of her plan to visit every ministry to exchange views with the senior officials and give directives to them to bring dynamism in their activities.

Sheikh Hasina reiterated that Khaleda Zia made political mistake by taking decision to boycott the January 5, 2014 general election. "Why the countrymen will pay for her wrong decision," she asked hoping that the Almighty Allah would help Khaleda Zia to unfold her good sense to refrain her from destructive policy.

Religious affairs minister M Motiur Rahman and secretary of the ministry Dr Chowdhury Md. Babul Hassan also spoke.

The premier said everything was going on under a systematic system. "But Begum Zia along with Jamaat is enforcing siege and blockade programmes at the same time out of their intention to multiply the public sufferings," she added.

She observed that the BNP leader might become insane, otherwise why she would stay in the office leaving her home day after day. "It's not clear what kind of revolution she wants to occur. But it's true that she is committing homicide and even burning children alive," the PM said.

"What is the achievement of BNP from this type of movement except killing some people, crippling many others, burn transports and destroying public and private properties," she said adding "if BNP thinks this destruction as their achievement, it's very unfortunate for the nation."

The prime minister said the government has decided to hold the SSC exams only on Friday and Saturday as children cannot go to exam hall at risk. "So a new routine has been prepared," she said apprehending that BNP-Jamaat might call hartal even enforce hartal in the weekends.

"The BNP and Jamaat trade on religions, so they cannot be trusted," she said adding that BNP-Jamaat doesn't want to make the people educated as if people are educated they would not be able to misguide them.
