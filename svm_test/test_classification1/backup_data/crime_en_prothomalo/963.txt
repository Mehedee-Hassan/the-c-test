Govt using officials to kill BNP men: Hannan Shah
Bangladesh Nationalist Party senior leader Brig Gen (retd) ASM Hannan Shah on Saturday accused the ruling Awami League of using officials to kill BNP leaders and followers providing them arms training by its associate body activists.

“The Awami League government is now patronising its officials alongside its party activists on criminal acts like killing and abduction,” he alleged.

Hannan Shah came up with the remarks while addressing a rally, organised by Swadhinata Prajanma Forum at the National Press Club, referring to a report with photographs recently published in a daily that shows a public servant and a public university teacher receiving arms training from an activist of Chhatra League, an associate body of Awani League.

He further said the government is trying to bring back the one-party Baksal rule in the country.

Hannan Shah, also a BNP standing committee member, demanded the withdrawal of restriction on the publication of the daily Amar Desh and the release of its acting editor Mahmudur Rahman for the sake of democracy and justice. ”Or else, people will pull the Sheikh Hasina government down through a fierce movement,” he added.

The BNP leader was critical of the proposed 16th amendment to the constitution empowering parliament to remove Supreme Court Judges on grounds of misconduct and incapacity, terming it a black law.
