EU iterates demand for abolition of death penalty
The European Union delegation to Bangladesh has called on the government to introduce a moratorium on executions as a first step towards definitive abolition of capital punishment.

The EU iterated its position in a statement on Thursday following execution of three persons including Mufti Hannan on Wednesday.

“Capital punishment is not a deterrent against crime and renders miscarriages of justice irreversible,” reads the statement.

The European Union universally opposes the use of capital punishment.
