Father gives deposition in Felani murder case
Felani's father accused a BSF member, not India, for the murder of his daughter.

He pressed the accusation while giving deposition in the re-trial of Felani murder case at the special court set up by Border Security Force (BSF) at Cooch Behar in India.

Felani was killed by BSF firing while he was crossing the barbed wire on the Anantapur border near Kurigram in January 2011.

A three-member team, consist of Felani's father Nurul Islam, government prosecutor Abraham Lincoln and Kurigram 45 BGB acting director Major Hemayetul Islam, returned around 8:00pm through Burimari check post after attending the court.

Nurul Islam said, "I said in the court that I earned my livelihood in India, so, I have no allegation against the country. But I accused BSF member Amiya Ghosh for the murder."

Amiya was present in the court during the deposition, he said.
