HC issues rule over rape of Garo girl
The High Court on Monday issued a rule asking the authorities why the raped Garo girl shall not be compensated.

The HC also asked why people who did not let the girl lodge a complaint shall not be brought to book.

The court asked the authorities concerned to respond by two weeks.

A High Court bench comprising Justice Farah Mahbub and Justice Kazi Izarul Haque Akand gave the order after hearing to a writ petition filed by five human rights organisations following the incident.

Till Sunday, the police could not arrest any suspect in the incident.

On May 21, the Garo girl was gang-raped on a moving microbus after she was forcibly taken into the vehicle from Jamuna Future Park area in Dhaka.
