Trader kidnapping: DU suspends 4 students
Dhaka University authorities on Sunday suspended four of its students, who are also Bangladesh Chhatra League leaders, for their involvement in kidnapping a Flexiload trader.

The action was taken against them under section 52 (2) of the Proctorial Rules, said a press release.

The students are Mamun, a second year student of the English Department, Sujon Ghosh, a master’s student of Sociology, Anupom Chandra, a master’s student of Nutrition and Food Science, and Himel, a second year student of Management Studies.

Earlier on Saturday, BCL, the associate student wing of the ruling Awami League, expelled the four for their involvement in anti-organisation activities.

Police on Friday rescued Farhad Islam from Jagannath Hall of the university, 15 hours after he was picked up from the capital’s Fakirerpool area.

Police arrested seven people, including six Dhaka University students, for their alleged involvement in this connection.
