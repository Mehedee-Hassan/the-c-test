India wants complete halt in cattle smuggling
Cattle smuggling and illegal infiltration are top on the agenda for the Indo-Bangladesh home secretary-level talks beginning Monday in Dhaka, reports PTI.

The meeting is being held in the wake of ‘deportation’ of ULFA leader Anup Chetia from Bangladesh.

Union home secretary Rajiv Mehrishi is expected to raise the issue of cattle smuggling to Bangladesh with his counterpart Mohammad Haque Khan and seek cooperation from that country to completely halt it, said the Indian state news agency.

According to an official estimate, smuggling of cattle to Bangladesh has come down by more than 70 per cent in recent times.

India’s home minister Rajnath Singh had reportedly said in September that about 20-22 lakh (2-2.2 million) cattle used to be smuggled every year to Bangladesh and it has come down to 2 to 2.5 lakh (200,000-250,000) cattle this year.

Bangladesh may raise the issue of killing of its citizens during cross-border firing by India's Border Security Force, according to PTI.

The BSF, on its part, has said that the firing has been result of its attempt to curb cattle smuggling on the directions of India’s central government.
