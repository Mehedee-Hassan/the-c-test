Ashraf wants coalition against communalism
Ruling Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam has urged all non-communal forces to unite in the fight against terrorism, reports UNB news agency.

“There can be differences of opinion in some cases. We have to be united against terrorism and militancy. Efforts to undermine anyone or to defeat them out of political expediency will in fact stand in our way in fighting terrorism,” said Syed Ashraf, while addressing a seminar at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre on Saturday.

The ruling party’s sub-committee on publicity arranged the seminar titled “Bangladesh Awami League to Face Communalism, Terrorism-Militancy under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina”.

Ashraf, also public administration minister, outlined steps taken by the prime minister to tackle the terror threat. He said, “As part of the government’s much-touted policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism, we continuously hear about law-enforcement agencies carrying out raids against terrorism.”

“Sheikh Hasina already has taken steps which were necessary to face terrorism. And she would take more steps in the future as needed. We want all non-communal forces to be united…strengthen the hands of Sheikh Hasina. Insha’Allah (God willing) we will win against terrorism.”

Ashraf was careful to note however that the threat posed by terrorism is present not just in Bangladesh, but also in “every country of the Middle East,” mainly blaming Saudi Arabia’s espousal of a type of communalism favouring the Sunni sect within Islam for the present state of chaos in Syria and Iraq.

Coming back to Bangladesh, Ashraf observed that communal forces are patronizing elements not just in the Middle-East, but also in Bangladesh. “They want a division between Shia and Sunni or Muslim and Hindu.

The present government can under no circumstances allow this. Sheikh Hasina is pledge-bound in this regard,” he reiterated.

Asked about joining the BNP’s council, taking place at the same time elsewhere in the capital, Ashraf claimed no AL representative would be in attendance as they were not invited.
