Happy to see beef price-hike!
India’s home minister Rajnath Singh has expressed satisfaction at the effects and effectiveness of the restriction on informal export of cattle heads to Bangladesh.

The Hindustan Times reports that the Indian government “patted its back for putting a check on the rampant smuggling of cattle across the India-Bangladesh border.”

The Indian minister reportedly told a function om cow conservation in New Delhi on Saturday that beef prices in Bangladesh had increased manifold following the crackdown by the Indian government on illegal smugglers.

Singh was quoted to have said he was briefed about this by the Bangladesh high commissioner and the DG of Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) on Friday.

“Our efforts have produced good results. We plan to take states, which share the boundary with Bangladesh, on board to completely stop smuggling of cows,” The Hindustan Times quoted Singh as saying.

Praising the Maharashtra government for banning cow slaughter, the minister said even the Mughals knew they would not be able to rule over the hearts of Indians while supporting cow slaughter, a fact that the British could not realize, according to the report.

At the same event, India’s environment minister Prakash Javadekar said his ministry was considering a proposal to use the rural employment guarantee scheme fund to grow grass that can be used as fodder for cattle.
