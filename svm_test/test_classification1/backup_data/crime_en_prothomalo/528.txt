Don’t resort to vote fraud, BNP to govt
BNP senior leader Hafizuddin Ahmed on Thursday urged the government not to resort to vote fraud in the 30 December local body elections for the sake of democracy.

“As a political activist, I humbly request the government not to destroy the country further in a bid to just hang onto power. You please don’t try to rig the election in the interest of democracy,” he told a discussion.

Hafiz, a BNP vice chairman, further said, “The bell of the municipality polls rang today (Thursday)…You all have seen what had happened during the Dhaka and Chittagong city corporations’ polls. We fear the municipality polls will be held in the same manner.”

Jatiyatabadi Muktijoddha Dal arranged the programme at the Jatiya Press Club.

The BNP leader alleged that the government has obliterated democracy and human rights in the country. “We’ve long been warning that militancy will emerge in a country where there is a lack of democracy.”

He called upon the government to ensure democratic practice and political space for the opposition for the sake of the country and its people.
