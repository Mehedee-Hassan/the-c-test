Man killed in RAB ‘shootout’
A man was killed Friday night in an incident described by the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) as a gunfight near a market in Feni’s Char Darbesh area.

The deceased was identified as Abul Kalam aka Bhagne Kalam, suspected chief of a pirate group.

According to RAB, the incident took place at around 8:00pm close to the Italian Market.

Members of RAB said they were tipped off about a robbery to take place in the market and conducted a drive in the area.

Sensing RAB’ presence, the gang opened fire on them, prompting them to counter attack.

According to RAB, Kalam was accused in more than 25 cases including murder, robbery and extortion.
