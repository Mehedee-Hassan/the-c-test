The International Crimes Tribunal-1 (ICT-1) on Tuesday condemned fugitive Syed M Hachen alias Hasan Ali of Kishoreganj to death for his crimes against humanity, including genocide, during the Liberation War in 1971.

The three-member tribunal, headed by Justice M Enayetur Rahim pronounced the verdict.

Earlier on April 20, closing the law-point arguments from both sides in the trial of the 1971 war crimes accused Syed M Hachen alias Hasan Ali, the International Crimes Tribunal-2 kept the verdict pending for any day.

It will be the 18th judgment of the tribunal as it earlier had delivered 17 verdicts.

On November 11 last year, the tribunal indicted Syed M Hachen alias Hasan Ali for his involvement in crimes against humanity during the Liberation War.

After fulfilling the requirement of law for the trial of a fugitive accused, the tribunal on September 15 took cognizance of the charges brought against war crimes accused Hasan who remained absconding since filing of the case.

According to the prosecution, the investigator has found Hasan’s involvement in some war crimes like murder, loot, arson, torture, deportation and genocide at Tarail in Kishoreganj and the proof of his collaboration with the Pakistan occupation forces as a member of its auxiliary outfit Razakar during the Liberation War in 1971.

On April, 3, 2014, the International Crimes Tribunal-1 issued a warrant of arrest against war crimes suspect Syed M Hachen for his alleged involvement in crimes against humanity in Kishoreganj during the 1971 Liberation War.
