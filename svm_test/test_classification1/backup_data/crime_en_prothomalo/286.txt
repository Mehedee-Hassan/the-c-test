'Government should take hard line'
Dignitaries on Saturday suggested that the government should take hard line to check terrorism.

The speakers at a discussion said the state should take hard line to protect life and property of countrymen. There is no need to bow before the terrorists for the cause of talks.

They also demanded a ban on Jamaat-Shibir and all sort of militant activities.

They made this observation at a discussion, titled ‘Dialogue against terrorism and sabotage’, jointly organised by the Institute of Conflict, Law and Development Studies in a city hotel.

Addressing the programme, Dhaka University vice chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique said, “Dialogue is not an alternative to terrorism. Those who are advocating for dialogue, are actually favouring terrorism.”

“BNP-Jamaat alliance doesn’t want any election or to establish the rights of the mass people .Their aim is to protect the war criminals,” he added.

Dr Anwar Hossain, faculty member of Dhaka University, suggested forming ‘despotic system of government' to prevent terrorism.

Business leader and Awami League-backed candidate for the upcoming Dhaka North City Corporation elections, Annisul Haq, suggested finding a sustainable way out of the ongoing unrest.

“If the government is compelled to go for talks facing the turbulence, could the party, thinking to take up the reins next, run the state?” the former FBCCI president questioned.

Among others, the acting president of Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee, Shahriar Kabir, women rights activist Rokeya Kabir and former chief information commissioner Md Jamir also spoke.
