AL men got freehand to kill opposition activists: Rizvi
Criticising the government and its growing repressive acts, Bangladesh Nationalist Party joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi on Wednesday alleged that the regime has given the ruling party men ‘licences’ to kill opposition activists.

“The current illegal government is implementing its all barbaric plans to annihilate the opposition…It’s given Jubo League and Chhatra League men free licences to kill and suppress the 20-party alliance leaders and activists,” he said.

Rizvi came up with the allegations at a press briefing at BNP’s Nayapaltan central office.

The arrest of ruling party cadres in connection with some murder cases is nothing but eyewash as they being released latter, he further alleged.

The BNP leader mentioned that Jubo Dal leader Kamal Uddin was hacked to death in broad daylight in Natore on Tuesday.

Condemning the killing, he demanded the government immediately arrest and mete out punishment of those involved in it.

Rizvi said the ruling Awami League has resorted to killings, abductions, repressions and various misdeeds only to hang onto power.

He claimed that the government-backed some student organisations are trying to create an obstacle to bringing Piash Karim’s dead body to Central Shaheed Minar at the behest of top leadership of the current regime.

Rizvi said the government even couldn't tolerate Piash Karim’s ‘dead existence’ as it could not tolerate his ‘living existence’. “They’re now trying to capture the Shaheed Minar as their paternal property.”

He warned that BNP together with people would put up a strong resistance against the government’s unfair and ill-treatment to Piash Karim.
