VDP member killed after rape by coworker
A female member of Village Defence Party (VDP) was killed after being raped by her male colleague at Shologhar union complex in Srinagar in Munshiganj on Wednesday.

Victim Parvin Akhter, 40, wife of day-labourer Ashraf Ali, was resident of Keyatkhali village.

Srinagar Police officer-in-charge Sheikh Mahbubur Rahman said Lal Mia raped Parvin at the UP complex in the morning as she was alone at that time. Later, Lal Mia strangled her to death.

When two persons went to the UP office at about 10:00am, Lal Mia did not allow them in, asking them to wait for some time but fled through the backdoor in the meantime.

As they smelt something fishy, the two persons entered the office only to see the body of Parvin lying.

Later, police recovered the body and sent it to Munshiganj General Hospital morgue for autopsy.

Victim’s elder son Asadul filed a murder case in this regard.

The OC said they launched a manhunt to arrest Lal Mia, a resident of Shamsabad village
