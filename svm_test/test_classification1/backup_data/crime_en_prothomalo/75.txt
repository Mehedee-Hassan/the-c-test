Country sees no democracy for 10 years: BNP
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has said Bangladesh has no longer been a democracy since October 2006.



“There has been no democracy in the country for the last 10 years from 28 October 2006 to till date. You’ve also snatched people’s right of expression. You’ve shut down 37 online news portals just in one day,” Fakhrul told a programme in the capital city on Saturday, according to UNB.



At least six activists of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami were beaten to death on Paltan road allegedly by activists of then opposition Bangladesh Awami League (AL) with oar (of boat-AL’s election symbol) and sticks on 28 October 2006 evening the day before BNP-Jamaat alliance government handed over power to Iajuddin-led caretaker government.

Alleged AL activists were seen dancing on the dead body of the Jamaat activists.

The UNB report adds: The BNP leader called on the people to wage a movement to defeat ‘undemocratic’ forces.

Labour Party, one of the components of the BNP-led 20-party alliance, arranged the programme at Segunbagicha's Kochi-Kacha Building auditorium, marking its 39th founding anniversary.

Fakhrul also said AL will be wiped out if people can exercise their voting rights in a free and fair election for its repressive acts and misrule.

He alleged that the government is not only subduing the opposition leaders and activists, but also gagging the civil society members, who raise voice for democracy and people’s rights, through issuing various threats.

He said people had liberated the country to exercise their democratic and basic rights and elect a government of their choice by voting. “But, you won’t allow them to hold a fair election as you know you’ll be wiped out if people get the right to cast their votes and express their opinions. You won’t be able to withstand the blow of a fair election for repressing people over the last 10 years.”

Questioning the acceptability of the 10th parliament, Fakhrul said it has a ‘domestic’ opposition with which foreigners do not meet. “Even Jatiya Party chairman also regretted that foreigners do not meet their party as there is no democracy in the country.”

The BNP leader said the ruling party leaders now cannot freely move without police escorting them in fear of facing public wrath for their misdeeds.

“We’ve repeatedly said we don’t want violence as we want a democratic atmosphere in which people will be able to exercise their franchise without any fear,” he observed.

Fakhrul came down heavily on ruling party leaders for what he said their comments that BNP cannot be allowed to go to power, saying it is a blueprint to cement one-party role by annihilating democracy.

He called upon leaders and activists of the 20-party alliance to make their unity stronger to oust the current regime through a vigorous movement. “There’s no alternative to uniting people and waging a movement to defeat the current usurper and undemocratic forces.”
