EC seeks withdrawal of Abdul Bari
The Election Commission has sent a letter to the public administration ministry to withdraw one of its project's deputy director, Abdul Bari, who along with some of his colleagues beat two television newsmen.



“A letter has been forwarded to the public administration ministry in this regard on Wednesday,” EC secretary Sirazul Islam told journalists at his office on Thursday.



Besides, the EC has formed a three-member probe body to investigate into the incident and the committee has been asked to submit its report within next three working days, the EC informed.

"We will get detail information about the incident after getting the probe report. Then, we will take further steps to this matter," he added.

A reporter and a cameraperson of a private TV channel, ‘Channel 24’, were assaulted by some EC officials led by Abdul Bari, deputy director at the EC’s NID wing, at Agargaon in the city on Wednesday noon.

The journalists went there around Wednesday noon to gather information on allegations that people were suffering when trying to make corrections on their national identity cards and get replacements for lost ones.

They, along with the office's security personnel, forcibly took the duo to the office of Abdul Bari and beat them up. They EC officials also damaged the camera of the television channel.

Meanwhile, the organisation of newsmen working on electoral affairs, Reporters’ Forum for Election and Democracy (RFED), on Thursday submitted a memorandum to the EC secretary demanding exemplary punishment of Abdul Bari and other officials involved in the journalist assault, compensation for damaging cameras and an environment conducive for collecting news in the EC and its offices.
