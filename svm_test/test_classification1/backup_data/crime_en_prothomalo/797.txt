Achievement of Bangladesh in women’s development is something, even at a global level, that meets the theme of this year’s Women’s Day -- Empowering Women, Empowering Humanity: Picture It!

The country has proved appreciable progress in women’s status as defined by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.

However, while making their in a few key sectors – agriculture, microcredit and garments – the Bangladeshi women still need fully congenial atmosphere at workplaces.

The women are also facing problems such as harassment in society and also violence in some cases as show different studies. Child marriage and dowry still remain a social problem that thwarts development and advancement of the women in rural areas.

The Bangladesh society has a long way to go to establish gender parity or equality between the women and the men in terms of their status and treatment in society.

Observing that the contribution of women to family, society and the state is immense, president Abdul Hamid underscored the need for ensuring their rights and empowerment alongside providing them with due honour.

In a message, he urged all to work together to protect the rights of women, ensure their empowerment and equal opportunities.
