Police fail to nab BCL men over teacher assault
Police are yet to arrest the offenders who on Thursday beat a teacher of Khulna Government Brajalal (BL) College .

Later, the BL college chairman of the political science department, professor Moniruzzaman, filed a case against the BCL leader Deepankar, Ujjal, Didar, and 15 unidentified people over the incident.

Daulatpur police office-in-charge Shafiqul Islam told Prothom Alo no one has been arrested yet in connection with the incident. Police are trying to arrest the offenders.

BCS Shadharan Shikkhak Shamiti of the college has declared a procession on the campus on Saturday, protesting the teacher beating.

The teacher’s platform also has threatened a strike if the perpetrators are not arrested till Sunday.

Members of the Awami League student wing beat an assistant professor of the political science of the college yesterday noon (Thursday).

The victim said he asked a fourth-year student Deepankar to meet him at the department to correct the name of his supervisor in examination paper as he wrote the name wrong.

Deepankar made a phone call to the vice president of the Khulna city BCL unit Ujjal Hossain, instead of meeting the teacher. The teacher then asked both to meet him at the department.

Ujjal, also the BL college BCL unit convenor, abused with the teacher and later beat him with his cohorts at the department.

At one stage, the teacher took shelter at department chairperson’s room.

The BCL men then vandalised chairs, tables and other furniture in the room.
