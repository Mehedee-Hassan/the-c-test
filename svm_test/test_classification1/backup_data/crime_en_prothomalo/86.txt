US condemns polls violence
The Unites States has called for investigating “transparently and impartially” all irregularities including violence during the just-held city corporation elections.

The US embassy in Dhaka, in a statement on Tuesday evening, made the call, expressing frustration at the rigging of votes.

"We are disappointed by widespread, first-hand, and credible reports of vote-rigging, intimidation and violence that have occurred at polling stations today (Tuesday)," according to the statement.

“We condemn in the strongest terms any use of violence for political objectives,” the statement said.

The US embassy also regretted the BNP’s decision to boycott the city corporation polls.

Without referring to possible repercussion to the elections, the US, however, called on “all parties involved to work within the law and avoid violence at all costs”.
