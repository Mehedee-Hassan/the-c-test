Rape verdict against Parimal 25 Nov
The verdict in the Viqarunnisa schoolgirl rape case filed against its former teacher Parimal Joydhar will be delivered on 25 November, says news agency UNB.

Saleh Uddin Ahmed, judge of the Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunal-4 of Dhaka, fixed the date on Tuesday on completion of arguments from both the prosecution and defence.

Twenty-eight witnesses out of total 40 made their depositions before the tribunal in the case.

Police produced accused Viqarunnisa Noon School and College ex-teacher Parimal Joydhar before the tribunal on Tuesday.

Special public prosecutor Forkan Miah said, “We had been able to prove the allegation against Parimal and we demand highest punishment for him.”

Meanwhile, defence counsel Mahfuz Miah claimed that the prosecution failed to prove the allegation, saying they will get justice.

Parimal sexually assaulted the class-X girl of Viqarunnisa Noon School and College confining her to a room of his house twice in May and June of 2011 and recorded the deplorable acts with his mobile phone.

On 5 July, 2011, the victim's father lodged a rape case with Badda police station against Parimal, Viqarunnisa principal Hosne Ara and its Bashundhara branch head Lutfur Rahman.

Detectives arrested Parimal from a relative's house in Keraniganj on 7 July of that year.

He made confessional statement before a court on 11 July, four days after his arrest.

Police submitted charge sheet before the court on 11 August in that year, dropping the names of Hosne Ara and Lutfur Rahman.

The court finally framed charges against Parimal on 7 March, 2012.

The formal trial started on 6 June, 2012 with the recording of depositions of the witnesses.
