Shewli loses eyesight
Tortured housewife Shewli Aktar has finally lost her eyesight, said ophthalmologist who operated on her eyes on Saturday.

“Unfortunately, Shewli will not be able to see in future. A pair of conformers has been set up, replacing her eyes so that her face does not look ugly,” National Ophthalmology and Hospital assistant registrar Atiqul Haque said.

The physician added, “She is out of danger now, but has broken down mentally.”

On Thursday afternoon Shewli’s husband Jewel Hasan gouged out her eyes by a knife and left away her body in a locked house in Tongi of Gazipur. Later, neighbours recued Shewli with the help of the police after hearing his screaming from inside.

She was taken to Tongi Government Hospital and later transferred to the National Ophthalmology and Hospital.

Shewli said, Rn that day, he (her husband Jewel) was drunk. At one stage, he asked me who came to the house today. He often suspects me without any substantial reason. Immediately, he taped my mouth and fastened my hands tightly from back and my two legs too. After a moment, I felt I've lost one of my eyes and fell unconscious.

When I got back sense, I understood I can't see anything except darkness. I removed the scotch tape on my mouth and shouted. I don't know any more than this, Shewli described the horrific moment.
