The investigation agency of the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has finalised investigation report on crimes against humanity allegedly committed by Obaidul Haque, alias Taher and Ataur Rahman alias Noni.

Mohammad Abdul Hannan Khan, coordinator and chief investigator of the agency said this at a press briefing at its Dhanmandi Safe house in Dhaka.

Khan, with the status of Inspector General of Police, said they had launched probe against Taher and Noni, two alleged prime operatives of Razakar Bahini in Netrokona on 6 June 2013 and concluded today.

"We have carried out the probe for almost one and half year and quizzed more than 80 in this regard. The duo was responsible for many heinous crimes committed during the war in Netrokona sadar and Barohatta areas. They are accused of being involved in the killings of 15 innocent civilians and setting fire to 400 or 450 houses. We have brought four charges against them," said Khan.

"Taher and Noni occupied the house of Moloy Bihari Biswas in Mukterpara area of Netrokona town. They had set up Razakar camp there. They carried out crimes like genocide, murder, arson, looting and tortures from that camp," he added.
