Verdict on Nizami appeal Wednesday
The Supreme Court will deliver its judgment on Wednesday on the appeal filed by condemned convict Jamaat-e-Islami ameer Matiur Rahman Nizami challenging the death penalty for his crimes against humanity during the Liberation War in 1971, says news agency UNB.

A four-member bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha, will deliver the verdict.

The other members of the tribunal are justice Nazmun Ara Sultana, justice Syed Mahmud Hossain and justice Hasan Foez Siddique.

On 8 December last, the Supreme Court fixed 6 January for delivering the verdict on the appeal filed by condemned convict Jamaat ameer Matiur Rahman Nizami.

Earlier, the defence placed their arguments on 30 November, 1 and 2 December while the prosecution completed submitting arguments on 8 December.

Earlier on 2 December, last, Nizami’s counsel Khandker Mahabub Hossain also prayed to the apex court for releasing him or giving him any other punishment instead of death penalty taking his age and physical condition into consideration.

On 29 October, 2014, the International Crimes Tribunal-1 sentenced Nizami to death for committing crimes against humanity, including genocide and the murder of intellectuals, during the Liberation War.

Nizami filed an appeal challenging the death sentence and claimed himself innocent and sought to be cleared of the charges on 23 November, 2014.
