Dy sec caught red handed while taking bribe
Anti-Corruption Commission officials caught red-handed a deputy secretary of the government while receiving bribe from a lessee at a fast-food shop in the capital’s Khilgaon on Sunday night.

The deputy secretary, Mizanur Rahman, is currently serving as a law officer on deputation at the Roads and Highways Department of the road transport and bridges ministry.

ACC director Nasim Anwar confirmed the news of Mizanur Rahman’s arrest to the Prothom Alo.

He said the ACC conducted the drive acting on a tip-off from Mainuddin Chowdhury, a lessee of the Roads and Highways Department.

Quoting Mainuddin, he further said Mizanur first took a bribe of Tk 1,90,000 and then demanded 9 lakh more in exchange of clarifying his file.

Mainuddin informed the commission over Mizanur’s illegal demand.

A team of ACC officials took their position at the Khilgaon fast-food shop and caught Mizanur red-handed while receiving the bribe money of Tk 50,000 from Mainuddin.

According to the ACC officials, Mizanur has been handed over to Khilgaon police station and he will be produced before a Dhaka court tomorrow (Monday).
