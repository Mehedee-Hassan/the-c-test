‘BCL men’ go on rampage in Mohakhali
Some activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League’s (BCL’s) Government Titumir College unit reportedly went on a rampage vandalising 20 vehicles and some shops in front of the college in the city’s Mohakhali area on Monday.

Officer-in-charge of Banani Police Station Bhuiyan Mahbub Hossain said a group of BCL men of the college suddenly took to the streets around 2:30pm and vandalised 15-20 vehicles and some footpath shops, creating panic among commuters and disrupting traffic from Amtali to Gulshan-1 for half an hour.

Police rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control firing 5-6 gunshots.

Vehicular movement on the road returned to normalcy around 3 pm, the OC said adding, “We’re trying to know behind the vandalism on the streets.”

Contacted, Titumir College unit BCL president Qazi Mirazul Islam Dolar told UNB, “Some youths of an area adjacent to the college used to beat up our students and stanched money from them.”

The incident occurred as a young man, Rabbi, beat up a student of the college in front of it today (Monday). Hearing the news, some of its students rushed in and beat up Rabbi, he said.

When Rabbi’s men threw brick chips at the college students, the general students took to the streets and carried out the vandalism, he said.

Later, BCL leaders of the college brought the situation under control and took them to the campus, Dollar claimed.
