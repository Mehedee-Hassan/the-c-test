Up to Tk 2m charged for hiring a univ lacturer: TIB
An amount ranging from Tk 300,000 to Tk 2 million is taken as bribe for recruiting an entry-level teacher called lecturer at eight of 13 public universities.

Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) has revealed this in a research report published at a press conference on Sunday.

The report also found that corrupt practices are committed at 12 public universities to make favour for candidates having blessings from the ruling party, Bangladesh Awami League.

"The picture is quite frustrating and worrying," TIB's executive director Iftekharuzzaman said demanding well-coordinated rules for such appointment.

The report titled "Appointing Lecturer at Public Universities: Challenges of good governance and their solution" was presented by two TIB researchers -- Dipu Roy and Rezaul Karim.

The report said irregularities in hiring of teachers at the universities begin even before the formal appointment. The process of forming the committee, setting the criteria of eligibility and system of accountability -- all are manipulated, according to the report.

In many cases, the teachers are found to have manipulated the result sheets to appoint the 'favoured' candidates.

Also, the report pointed out, the teachers allegedly favoured the female students having special relations with them.

The university syndicates overlooked the process of note of dissent and endorsed the the favoured candidates, the report said.
