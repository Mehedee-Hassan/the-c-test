All in judiciary not angels: CJ
Chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha on Saturday admitted that there is certain amount of corruption among the people of the judiciary.



He also rued the massive irregularities have plagued 'every nook and corner' of the country these days.



"Whereas corruption has pervaded every part and sector of the country, the judiciary can't be an isolated island so that there will be no irregularities and that everyone in the judiciary will remain angels," he told a function at Dhaka University campus.



Justice Sinha, however, expressed his views that the corrupt elements would not be more than 5-10 per cent in the entire judiciary.



He still feels that it is possible to serve the people despite the existence of corrupt practices.

The chief justice vented his anguish at the launching ceremony of two books written by Law Commission member professor Shah Alam at Nabab Nawab Ali Senate auditorium.

He said most of the laws in the country have become obsolete.

"The judiciary would further fall flat if the laws are not amended," he added.

Coming down heavy on the legislature, SK Sinha said there had been extensive debates on laws in parliament. But, he added, there is no discussion or debate on laws nowadays.

"Hence laws with defects are passed in parliament today, causing people’s suffering and placing pressure on the judiciary," he lamented.
