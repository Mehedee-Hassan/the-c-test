The BCU activists were staging a pre-announced demonstration as a protest against police's inability to arrest culprits involved in sexual assaults on women on the Dhaka University campus during the Pahela Baishkah celebrations.

When police tried to stop them in the Minto Road area, a clash ensued.

Police charged baton on the agitators, which left several BCU activists injured.
