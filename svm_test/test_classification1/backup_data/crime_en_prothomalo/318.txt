Govt unleashed terrorism, rigged elections: Rizvi
BNP joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi alleges that the government has gone on a rigging spree unleashing terrorism in the third phase of upazila council elections.



Rizvi brought the allegation before newsmen after emerging from the prayer session for the late BNP secretary general Khandkar Delwar Hossain marking the third anniversary of his death at the party's central office at Naya Paltan in Dhaka.



The BNP spokesperson also said that his party would throw programmes soon protesting against the vote rigging and abominable conduct of the election commission.



Awami League activists captured most of the polling stations of 20-25 upazilas and AL lawmakers and ministers maneuvered their clout to influence the electoral process, he alleged.
