The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) on Monday launched an investigation into allegations of embezzlement of bank money by managing director of Prime Bank Ahmed Kamal Khan Chowdhury.

Chowdhury has been accused of misappropriating an amount of Tk 3.92 crore, according to sources in the ACC.

The sources said the commission has received important documents, from the MD, required for investigation. The ACC officials have begun the process maintaining “strict privacy”, the sources added.

The ACC sources said Chowdhury embezzled Tk 3,92,19,014 using his power and tempering vouchers of the bank.

The ACC has decided to investigate the allegations on 13 January this year after initial scrutiny.

The commission has appointed its assistant director Gulshan Anwar to investigate the allegations.
