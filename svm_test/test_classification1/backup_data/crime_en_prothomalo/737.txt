More suspected masterminds identified, claims minister
Home minister Asaduzzaman Khan on Thursday said more suspected masterminds of recent militant attacks in the country have been identified other than Bangladesh-origin Canadian Tamim Chowdhury and sacked army man Major Syed Mohamad Ziaul Haque.

The minister came up the disclosure while speaking at a discussion meeting at the National Press Club.

Awami Shilpa Gosthi organised the programme on the occasion of the National Mourning Day.

Asaduzzaman said those who have been identified are under the surveillance of law enforcers, and a process is going on to arrest them.

The law enforcers are trying to curb militancy and the country must be freed from militants because people are with the law enforcers, he added.

Asaduzzaman said those involved in Bangabandhu's assassination, and attempted to kill Bangabandhu’s daughter Sheikh Hasina 19 times are inseparable to the recent militant attackers.

Some 22 people, including 17 foreign nationals, were killed in the grisly Gulshan attack on 30 June-1 July and two policemen and a woman were killed in another attack near the country's biggest Eid-ul Fitr congregation at the Sholakia Eid ground on 7 July last.
