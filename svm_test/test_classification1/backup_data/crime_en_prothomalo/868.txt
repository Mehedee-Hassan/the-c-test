I’ll bring them to book: Joy
Prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s son Sajeeb Wazed Joy on Monday threatened to sue the BNP leaders who, he alleged, planned to abduct him.

Joy, also the ICT advisor to the prime minister, in his Facebook status, reacted to the reports on plans to abduct him.

"When someone tries to kill me I take it very personally. I intend to pursue those responsible, no matter how high up they may be in the BNP. I will bring them to justice," he wrote.

Joy said on 4 March he provided a victim statement in court before the sentencing of Rizvi Ahmed Caesar, son of the vice-president of BNP’s cultural wing JaSaS. Mohammad Ullah Mamun.

The US court on Thursday sentenced two persons, including Caesar, over a bribery scheme for collecting information on Joy to kidnap and harm Joy and his family members, reports BSS.

Joy further mentioned on the post , "Caesar was promised US $40,000 per month and given the first payment of US $30,000 in cash directly from very senior BNP leaders in Bangladesh. I cannot disclose their names because the investigation is ongoing. The BNP had planned to kidnap and kill me here in the US."

Labeling the incident ' not a political practice ', he said, "These are not the actions of a political party. These are the actions of terrorists. This is what you expect from a group that burns innocent women and children alive."

Castigating the civil society and newspapers, Joy said, "The newspapers and our “civil society” who never fail to speak against the Awami League are absolutely silent on this. The BNP can kill and kidnap, yet they will never blame the BNP directly. They always blame both parties. So what justification can they offer for the BNP trying to kill me here?"
