SI withdrawn over DU sexual assault
A sub-inspector of Shahbagh police station has been withdrawn on Wednesday in connection with the sexual assault on women on Dhaka University campus during the Pahela Baishakh celebrations.

The sub-inspector, Ashraful Alam, was the on-duty officer in the area when the incident took place.

Sirajul Islam, officer-in-charge of Shahbagh police station, said Bangladesh Chhatra Union activists claimed to have handed over an offender to Ashraful, something the SI denied.

Sirajul said they are looking into the matter and steps will be taken after the investigation report is submitted.

Saddam Hossain, general secretary of BCU, said, "Only two policemen were present on the spot. We called other policemen from nearby areas for help but they refused to come to the scene."

"We handed over two perpetrators to the policemen but later we learned that they were freed," he added.

On 14 April, several women, including minor girls, were sexually assaulted near Shuhrawardy Udyan on Dhaka University campus as they came to celebrate the Pahela Baishakh.
