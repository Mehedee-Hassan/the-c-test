BNP submits memo to DC offices
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) submitted the copies of a memorandum to the deputy commissioners’ (DCs) offices across the country on Thursday, protesting what it said the widespread vote fraud by ruling party men during the 15 March third phase upazila council elections.



The party leaders and activists besieged the DC offices and submitted the memo copies, containing their demands.



In Dhaka, the party followers, led by its Dhaka district unit president Abdul Mannan, took position in front of the DC office about 12:00pm and later submitted a memorandum to DC Yusuf Harun.



BNP law affairs secretary Ziaur Rahman Khan and former Savar MP Dewan Salauddin were, among others, present.



Talking to reporters, after submitting the memorandum, Abdul Mannan said, “Violence has marked a sharp rise in the upazila council polls. We’ve submitted the memorandum protesting it. We want the polls to be held in a free and fair manner and we hope the district administration will take all necessary measures to this end.



Contacted, BNP joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said that their party men laid siege to DC offices in other districts too and submitted the memorandum.



Earlier on Tuesday, Rizvi announced the countrywide protest programme.
