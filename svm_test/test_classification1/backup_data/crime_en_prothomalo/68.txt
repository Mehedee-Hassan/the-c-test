US concerned at ongoing violence
Washington has expressed serious concern at the ongoing unrest and condemned the use of violence for political purpose.

The US department of state on Thursday also called on the Awami League government to provide necessary space for peaceful political activity.

State department deputy spokesperson Marie Harf also said the US called on all parties to instruct their members to refrain from violence.

"We condemn in the strongest terms the use of violence for political objectives. There’s simply no justification for such actions in a democratic Bangladesh," she said in a statement.

Harf said all Bangladeshis must have the right and the ability to express their views peacefully.
