Rights activists want justice for Gaibandha Santals
Human rights activist Sultana Kamal on Friday demanded justice in the recent killing and looting of Santal community in Gaibandha.

“It is horrific to see this kind of brutal and inhumane incidents happenning in the independent Bangladesh. We demand justice in the killing and looting incidents,” she said.

She came up with the call at a press conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity jointly organsied by Bangladesh Adivasi Forum, Jatiya Adivasi Parishad and Nagarik Samaj, protesting against the attacks on Santal community in Gaibandha recently.

Writer and columnist Syed Abul Maksud said if law and order deteriorates in any place, police are responsible to face the situation.

“But in last few years, we see a new trend that was usually seen during Pakistan period. In 1971, we saw that Al Badr and Razakar forces were with Pakistani soldiers. Now we see some students and youths are going with police like Al-Badrs and Razakars in every place of incident and take part in looting and arson.”

Bangladesh Adivasi Forum's general secretary Sanjeeb Drong and Oikya NAP president Pankaj Bhattacharya also spoke on the occasion.
