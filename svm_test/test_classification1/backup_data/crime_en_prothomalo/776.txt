Form body to probe cop assault on journo: HC
The High Court on Sunday directed the home secretary to form a two-member committee to look into the police assault on Ekushe Television journalist Akhil Poddar.

Asking the home secretary to come up with a report on October 21 after investigating the incident, the court also ordered the officer-in-charge of Kumarkhali Police Station in Kushtia to record an first information report (FIR) within 24 hours in connection with the assault.

The HC bench comprising Justice Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury and Justice Md Ashraful Kamal asked the Kumarkhali OC to submit a report on September 17 on the compliance of its order.

The court also issued a rule upon the government to explain why legal action should not be taken against those responsible for assaulting the journalist and why inaction to record a case in this regard should not be declared illegal.

The home secretary, the inspector general of police, the deputy commissioner, the police super, an assistant police super of Kushtia, the OC and assistant sub-inspector Abul Kalam Azad of Kumarkhali have been asked to reply to the rule within four weeks.

The High Court came up with the orders and the rule following a writ petition filed by Akhil Poddar, a special correspondent of private television channel ETV.

ASI Abul Kalam Azad along with his force stopped Akhil Poddar at Jilapitola intersection under Kumarkhali police station at about 8:30pm on August 26 when he along with another local journalist Monirul Islam Moni was returning to his village home at Khoksa from Kushtia town by a motorcycle.

At one stage, the police officer physically assaulted Akhil Poddar after an altercation. He took them to the police station handcuffed. Later, they were freed as the local journalists cordoned off the police station demanding their release.
