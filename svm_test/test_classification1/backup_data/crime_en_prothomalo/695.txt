RAJUK thoroughly corrupt: ACC chief
Acting chairman of Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) Nasir Uddin Ahmed on Wednesday said country’s capital development authority Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK) is tainted by corruption from top to bottom.

The anti-corruption watchdog chief came up with the remarks while addressing a public hearing held at the Institution of Diploma Engineers, Bangladesh (IDEB) in the capital.

Earlier on 27 January, the ACC had organised a hearing on public sufferings in receiving services from the RAJUK.

The ACC authorities Wednesday held a follow-up hearing after 37 customers again complained that they did not get services as per the commitments given by the RAJUK officials during the January hearing.

Most of the service takers alleged that they did not receive the delivery of the service even 10 months after the regular timeline.

On 27 January hearing, over 70 complaints were lodged with the ACC and RAJUK officials had promised to provide services to the customers in due time.
