UNICEF concrned at violence against children
UNICEF Bangladesh has expressed grave concerns at the recent killing of a 10-year-old boy in a heinous manner in Narayanganj.

“This is a serious violation of child rights,” the UNICEF said in a statement on Wednesday.



The global body also reiterated its apprehension of children being used as easy targets of violence and said child labour is still widespread in both formal and informal sectors.

UNICEF urged the government of Bangladesh and the Supreme Court to take speedy legal action against these violent incidents and bring the perpetrators to justice.

UNICEF requested the government to revisit the concluding observations of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child Committee and commit actions to end violence against children, child marriage and child labour.



UNICEF strongly urged the government to set up and strengthen child protection systems and child rights monitoring mechanisms by activating Child Welfare Boards at national and local level as stipulated in the Children Act 2013.
