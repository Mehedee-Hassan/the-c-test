PM inaugurates smart ID cards distribution tomorrow
The Election Commission (EC) will start distribution of machine-readable smart national identity (NID) cards among 100 million citizens tomorrow, replacing the existing laminated cards.



Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to inaugurate the distribution of the smart NID cards at a function at Osmany Memorial Hall in the city.



Election Commissioner M Shah Newaz earlier told BSS that the EC would collect biometric details, impression of 10 fingers and picture of iris of the card holders during the distribution of smart cards.



For being machine readable the smart cards have additional safety measures against forgery.

According to EC Secretariat Director (public relations) SM Asaduzzaman Arzu, after the inaugural programme, smart NID cars would be first handed over to the president, the prime minister and members of national cricket team.

The distribution of NID cards will begin in two city corporations in Dhaka and in a remote area in Kurigram the following day. Then smart cards would be distributed at upazila, municipality, union and ward levels in phases.

EC officials said the number of voters in the country is about 100 million at present. Around 80 million citizens got laminated NID cards eight years ago for the first time. But some unscrupulous people are forging those cards. The machine-readable smart cards will prevent this forgery.

To maintain security of the smart cards, 25 international certifications and standards have been ensured. The microchips in smart cards will contain all information of a citizen.

The card holders will get 22 types of services, including banking, TIN, driving license and passport.

EC officials said, though the smart NID cards would be given free of cost, the cardholder will have to pay a fixed amount of money if he or she goes to collect a new one after losing it twice.
