Crackdown on Rohingyas tantamount to genocide: UK HC
British high commissioner in Dhaka Alison Blake has said the crackdown on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar spearhead by the country’s army is tantamount to genocide.



The western diplomat made the observation after she along with the high commissioners of two commonwealth countries in Bangladesh visited Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar on Thursday.



The two others are Australian high commissioner Julia Niblett and Canadian high commissioner Benoit-Pierre Laramée. They visited registered and unregistered Rohingya camps in Kutupalang of Ukhia upazila in the morning.



During the visit, they listened to the accounts of torture, repression, rape and killing the Rohingyas had undergone before they fled Myanmar.

The high commissioners also had a meeting with officials of the refugee camps.

“We came to know the plights of Rohingya people. The description of torture, rape and killing the Rohingyas who fled Myanmar have given us is very brutal. This is tantamount to genocide,” Alison Blake told a media briefing after the visit.

At the press conference, the envoys said they will work with the international community to resolve the Rohingya crisis.
