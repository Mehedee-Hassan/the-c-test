Admission seeker jailed for forgery
A mobile court on Friday sentenced an admission seeker to two years jail for using electronic device in Dhaka University’s Ka-unit admission test.

The convict is Hasibul Hasan.

University sources said Hasibul Hasan was caught red handed with an electronic device at an examination centre in the city’s Mohammadpur during a Ka-unit entrance test.

A mobile court was set up at the proctor office of the Dhaka University. Executive magistrate Moushumi Mahbub passed the order of Hasib’s two-year imprisonment.

Later, Hasibul was sent to Shahbag police station.

The DU acting proctor said the seized device looks like a MasterCard that can be used as mobile phone after inserting a SIM card inside it. A tiny earphone also found in his possession.

Hasibul has confessed his crime, the proctor added.

Hasibul, however, said that a DU IIT student Fahad Mahmul provided him the answers of admission test question by the device during the test for Tk 6 lakh.
