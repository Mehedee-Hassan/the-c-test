SC stays Tarique PS Apu's HC bail
The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed for four weeks the bail granted by the High Court to Miah Nuruddin Apu, personal secretary (PS) to BNP senior vice-chairman Tarique Rahman, in a case filed for extortion.

Chamber Judge Justice Mohammad Imman Ali of the Appellate Division passed the order following an appeal filed by the state.

On August 18, a vacation bench of the High Court granted six months' bail to Apu.

Senior lawyer Jainul Abedin stood for Apu while Additional Attorney General Murad Reza represented the state.

Apu was an accused in two separate cases.

Amin Ahmed, a contractor, filed an extortion case against Apu with Gulshan Police Station on March 8, 2007.

After remaining fugitive since 2007, Apu returned home from Malaysia on June 17 and surrendered before the court on June 18, seeking bail.

The court sent him to jail rejecting his bail petition.

He was accused in another Tk 210 million bribery case filed by the Anti Corruption Commission (ACC). He was shown arrest in the case on June 23.
