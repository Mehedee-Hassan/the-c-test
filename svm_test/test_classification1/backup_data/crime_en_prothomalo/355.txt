‘Cricket bookie’ held in Benapole
Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) members detained a suspected Indian cricket bookie from immigration building at Benapole check post on Thursday night.

Benapole check post immigration officer Monir Hossain said Atnu Dutt, also a member of an international gold smuggling syndicate, might have come to Bangladesh for taking bet on the ICC World Twenty20.

There was an embargo on his leaving Bangladesh for the last three days, he said.

Jessore Rab-6 sources said Rab members detained Atnu when he deposited his passport to the immigration office for going back to India.

Rab members took away Atnu for interrogation.
