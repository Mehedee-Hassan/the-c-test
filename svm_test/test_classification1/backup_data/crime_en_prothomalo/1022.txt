Woman sues husband on rape charge in Barguna
A woman has filed a rape case against her husband with a local court.

Taking cognisance of the charge, judge of the Women and Children Repression Tribunal Shariful Islam on Sunday asked the local municipality councillor to submit a report to the court after investigating the allegation.

According to the case statement, Zahirul Islam of Nayakata road in Barguna municipality area and Reba Begum of Uttar Lakurtala in Sadar upazila married each other 18 years back. They had been blessed with two children.

However, the couple got separated in 2005 after Reba filed a dowry case against Shariful with a local court.

They remarried each other on May 5 this year and started living together after the matter was settled at a local arbitration.

But Shariful divorced Reba again on May 8, only three days later.

However, he concealed the matter and continued to live with her.

Reba filed the case after she came to know about the divorce on July 20.
