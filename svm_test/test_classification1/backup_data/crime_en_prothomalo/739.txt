‘Law against defaming Liberation War soon’
Law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister Anisul Huq has said the government will draw up a new law to prevent derogatory remarks against the Liberation War.

The minister came up with the disclosure on Sunday addressing a question-answer session at the national parliament.

Responding to a question of ruling member of parliament (MP) Waresat Hossain, Anisul Huq said that the tendency of distorting history of the Liberation War and of that period has become a habit of some irresponsible politicians after the assassination of the father of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family members in 1975.



In this context, punitive action will be taken if any person defames the history of Liberation War by providing dubious or untrue information, he added saying that the government is actively considering the enactment of the Liberation War defamation law.



In responding to a supplementary question from AL MP Waresat Hossain, the law minister said the government will soon start working on the draft of the law.
