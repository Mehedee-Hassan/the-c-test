Polygamist held in Comilla
Police held a polygamous person at Hatimara village in Monaharganj upazila of Comilla on Friday in a dowry-related case filed by his eighth wife.

The detainee was Abu Zafar, 55, son of late Abdul Hamid of the village.

Locals said Zafar married Maksuda Akhter, daughter of Shafiqur Rahman of Paschim Dhonbari in Chouddagram upazila in 2005 as his eighth wife.

After the marriage, he created pressure on his wife to bring Tk 5 lakh from her father for going aboard.

Later, he went aboard with Tk 3.8 lakh given by Maksuda's father.

Returning home in 2011, Zafar again demanded Tk 5 lakh as dowry from his father-in-law.

Refused, he had started torturing Maksuda.

Afterwards, Maksuda lodged a case against his husband with a local court. The court issued a warrant for his arrest as he refrained from appearing before it.

Maksuda said after marriage, she came to know that greedy Zafar earlier married seven girls and later four more.

Monaharganj police in-charge Abdul Hai Sarker said they produced Zafar before the court concerned which sent him to jail.
