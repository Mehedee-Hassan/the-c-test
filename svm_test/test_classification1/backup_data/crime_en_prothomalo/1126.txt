France condemns, US shocked at blogger murder
A number of countries and international organisations including the media have reacted to the murder of blogger Washiqur Rahman in Dhaka on Monday.

On Tuesday, the United States expressed deep shock and France condemned the killing of the blogger.

France on its embassy website called on the Bangladesh authorities to investigate these killings and conveyed its condolences to his family and his relatives.

The US embassy in Dhaka said in a statement, “We’re horrified and deeply saddened by the murder of Washiqur Rahman Babu, and we offer our condolences to his family and friends.”

It said the United States firmly supports freedom of expression for all people and this is a universal human right, both in Bangladesh and throughout the world.

New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) insisted that the Bangladesh authorities should investigate the murder of the blogger in capital Dhaka and bring the perpetrators to justice.

“The Bangladeshi government must urgently establish accountability in this murder case and others--otherwise the rest of the country's bloggers, commentators, and journalists covering sensitive topics remain at grave risk of being attacked as well,” said CPJ Asia Program Coordinator Bob Dietz.

Al-Jazeera reported that a blogger has been hacked to death in Bangladesh's capital by three men "over alleged anti-Islamic writings, with two of the suspected attackers caught near the scene".

CNN published a story on the murder incident tiled "Washiqur Rahman: Another secular blogger hacked to death in Bangladesh.’

The New York Times published another story headlined "Blogger hacked to death in Bangladesh's capital."

The Washington Post's headline reads "‘Islamists hack another blogger to death in Bangladesh."

The Hindu reported on Tuesday -- ‘Another killing over freedom of expression."
