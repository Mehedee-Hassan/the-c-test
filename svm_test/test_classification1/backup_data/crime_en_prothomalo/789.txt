Committees to probe sexual assault on campus
Dhaka metropolitan police have formed two separate committees to probe into the sexual assault on several women amid the Baishakh celebration on the Dhaka University campus.

Monirul Islam, joint commissioner of DMP, told the newsmen on Saturday one committee will probe the sexual assault while another will look into the role of the policemen in this incident.

He said none of the miscreants have been identified yet from the CCTV clips, neither the victims showed up.

He said the victims are requested to contact with the law enforcement agencies. The identity of the victims will not be revealed.

He also urged for the help of the witnesses for the investigation.

The Dhaka University committee on prevention of sexual harassment has started its investigation. The witnesses have any evidence; they are requested to submit a written document to Professor Nasreen Ahmad, the convener of the committee.

The High Court issued a rule on Thursday asking why legal steps will not be taken against the people involved in assaulting women. The court also ordered the vice chancellor of Dhaka University and the inspector general of police to investigate the matter and submit a report within one month.
