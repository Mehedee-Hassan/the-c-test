Shafiq Rehman attempted to kidnap Joy, claims police
Senior journalist and television presenter Shafiq Rehman was arrested for his alleged link with an attempt of kidnapping Sajib Wazed Joy in the US, said Maruf Hossain Sarder, deputy commissioner (Media) of Dhaka metropolitan police (DMP).



Rehman was arrested by the DB from his residence at about 8am in connection with a lawsuit filed to this effect with Paltan police station in Dhaka in August 2015. He has been taken to the DB office for primary interrogation.

Maruf Hossain said the Paltan police have unearthed the link of journalist Shafiq Rehman with the conspiracy of planned kidnapping and killing of Sajib Wazed, son of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, in the USA in 2015.



He said the police found that Shafiq visited the USA in 2013 and took part in the conspiracy at that time. Two US citizens and a Bangladesh national are now being tried in the US in the case of conspiracy to kidnap and kill Joy, he added.
