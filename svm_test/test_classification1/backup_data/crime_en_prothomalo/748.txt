Khaleda has to sever relations with militancy: Inu
Information minister Hasanul Haq Inu on Saturday said Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson Khaleda Zia has to cut off relations with militancy and communal forces to establish peace in the country.

"We should reach a national agreement regarding rooting out militancy from Bangladesh to make it a happy and prosperous country," he made the comments in an interview with BSS.

About current political crisis, he said, "This is not merely a conflict between the two leaders or political parties. Basically, it is a political and ideological conflict."

Inu said after the assassination of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975, Ziaur Rahman had started off clashes through rehabilitating the anti-liberation forces.

The country's democracy came under threat repeatedly as military rulers, including general Zia and BNP chief Khaleda Zia, patronized militancy and communal forces, he added.

"If we want to strengthen democracy and democratic process, we have to combat militancy and war criminals completely," the minister asserted.
