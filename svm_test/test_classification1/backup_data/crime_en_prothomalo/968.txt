Hasina plotting to kill Khaleda: BNP
Reacting to the bar on food supply to BNP leader Khaleda Zia's Gulshan office, the party has accused prime minister Sheikh Hasina of hatching conspiracy to kill her political rival.

BNP joint secretary Salahuddin Ahmed said on Thursday that the police stopped supply of foods to the BNP chairperson's office since Wednesday night, forcing Khaleda Zia and her officials there to starve.

"Sheikh Hasina is conspiring to kill Khaleda Zia in a cruel manner by stopping supply of food now, after cutting power, telephone, fax and internet connections to the office," he said in a statement.

The BNP leader mentioned that repressive measures such as using pepper spray, water cannon and trucks laden with sands to obstruct movement of Khaleda Zia, the Awami League government had set bad precedent, damaging Bangladesh's modest image in the world.

Referring to the party chief's courage and determination despite intimidation by the state machinery, the BNP leader said. "Khaleda Zia is ready to make any sacrifice for realising the demand of the people for restoration of democratic rights. "Her movement will continue until the Awami League government steps down."

Salahuddin alleged that the AL is trying to brand the BNP as a militant and terrorist organisation.

"As part of such conspiracy, it (AL) is engaged in acts of sabotage and hurling petrol bombs by using miscreants and trying to victimise the political rivals," he added.
