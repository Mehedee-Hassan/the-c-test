BNP leader Aman freed on bail
BNP joint general secretary Amanullah Aman was released on bail from jail on Sunday, reports news agency UNB.

He walked out of the prison cell at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) in the evening after the bail order reached the jail authorities, said Nesar Ali, jailer of Dhaka Central Jail.

On 2 August, separate Dhaka courts sent Aman to jail in a number of cases filed for arson attacks and vandalism during the BNP-led 20-party alliance’s blockade and hartal programme, rejecting his bail petitions.

He was later shifted to the DMCH prison cell from the Dhaka Central Jail on 23 August after he felt sick.
