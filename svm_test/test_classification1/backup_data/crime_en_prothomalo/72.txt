Man held with 5kg gold at Dhaka airport
Customs officials at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport seized 50 gold bars weighing around 5 kgs from a domestic passenger of Regent Airways coming from Chittagong on Tuesday evening, reports news agency UNB.

Sources at the Dhaka Customs House said the flight landed at the airport around 6:30pm from Bangkok via Chittagong.

The passenger identified as Jasim Uddin, 40, boarded the flight from Chittagong airport as a domestic passenger, said assistant commissioner (customs) of Dhaka Customs House Shahiduzzaman.

Acting on a tip-off, a customs preventive team challenged Jasim when he was about to leave the domestic terminal.

Searching his body, the 50 gold bars were recovered from his shoes, the AC added.

Jasim might have received the gold consignment from another passenger coming from Bangkok, he said.
