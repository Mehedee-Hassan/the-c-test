Bomb attack on Maitree Express
Miscreants on Sunday hurled a petrol bomb at the Dhaka-bound Maitree Express from Kolkata near Ishawardi rail station in Pabna.

However, no casualty was reported in the incident.

Maitree Express director Helal Uddin said some miscreants hurled a petrol bomb at the train around 3:00pm, which set the outer part of the engine on fire.

As the attack created panic among the passengers, the train was immediately brought back to the station where the blaze was doused.

The train left Ishwardi around 4:30pm after the damaged engine was replaced.
