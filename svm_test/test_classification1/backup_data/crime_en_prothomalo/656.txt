ACC pledges lenience if embezzled money returned
The Anti-Corruption Commission will be lenient on the embezzlers if they return the money they had misappropriated through the banks, ACC commissioner (investigation) AFM Aminul Islam said on Monday.

He was addressing a programme organised to mark the 12th founding anniversary of the ACC at the Shilpakala Academy auditorium in Dhaka.

Speaking as chief guest, Bishwa Sahitya Kendra founder Abdullah Abu Sayeed said, "The Bangladesh we dream of, cannot to established if we fail to contain corruption."

He stressed bringing the people behind large scale corruption to book, the way petty corrupt faces are being nabbed.

"It's the powerful who commit corruption the most. We have to show everyone that no one indulging in corrupt practices will be spared," he added.

ACC chairman Iqbal Mahmud said: "It's been 12 years since ACC was formed, but the gap between public expectations and our achievement is frustrating. ACC is plagued with a number of problems, including faulty mechanism and corruption. But we are determined to bring about a change."

ACC commissioner Nasiruddin Ahmed, secretary Abu Md Mostafa Kamal and director general Mohammad Munir Chowdhury also spoke on the occasion.
