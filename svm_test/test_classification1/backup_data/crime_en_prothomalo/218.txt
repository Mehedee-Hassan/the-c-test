Shaukat Mahmood put on 4-day fresh remand
A Dhaka court has put BNP chairperson’s adviser and journalist leader Shaukat Mahmood on a four-day fresh remand in four separate cases.

The Dhaka metropolitan magistrate, Shahriar Mahmud Adnan, on Monday granted the remand after he was produced before the court for hearing of four cases filed for subversive activities.

Investigation officers (IOs) of the cases on Sunday filed separate petitions with the court of the Dhaka metropolitan magistrate, seeking a 10-day remand in each case after showing him arrested in the cases, general recording officer (GRO) of the CMM court Aminur Rahman said.

The court had fixed Monday for hearing the remand petitions, he said.

The cases-five with Paltan police station and three with Motijheel police station-were filed against Shaukat Mahmood on charges of vandalism and arson attacks in January this year during hartal and blockade programmes enforced by the BNP-led 20-party alliance.

Earlier, a court on Saturday sent Shaukat Mahmood to jail on the expiry of his three-day remand in an arson case filed with the city’s Ramna police station.

On 19 August, the court placed Shaukat Mahmood on a three-day remand after his arrest from in front of Samurai Convention Centre in the city’s Panthapath area on 18 August.
