5 top govt officers to face action for forging FF certificates
The government has decided to take actions against five top officers for forgery in obtaining freedom fighter certificates.

Public administration ministry will likely to send notices to three secretaries and a joint secretary to show causes behind their actions.

The cabinet division has already been asked to take necessary actions against Privatisation Commission chairman Molla Waheduzzaman who is having the rank of a state minister. The authorities concerned first cancelled Waheduzzaman’s certificate but later withheld that.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina approved a proposal in this regard on Monday.

The certificates of former health secretary Niaz Uddin Mia, Public Service Commission secretary AKM Amir Hossain, former liberation war affairs ministry secretary KM Masud Siddiqui and joint secretary Abul Kashem Talukder were cancelled through a gazette notification issued by the liberation war affairs ministry on September 22.

Public administration ministry secretary Kamal Abdul Naser Chowdhury said they [the secretaries] will be asked to show causes by 10 days.

Actions are being taken according to the Government Servants (Discipline & Appeal) Rule, he added.
