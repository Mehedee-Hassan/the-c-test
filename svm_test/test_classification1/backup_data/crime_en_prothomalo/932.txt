BCL hands over 9 students to BUET authorities
Ruling Awami League’s student wing Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) activists on Monday handed over nine students of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) to the university administration for their alleged involvement with Islami Chhatra Shibir and militant outfits.

The names and identities of the nine students could not be known yet.

The acting president of the Nazrul Islam Hall unit of BCL, Anwar Habib said, BCL interrogated a student, Tareq, for his suspected involvement with Shibir, who later named eight other BUET students. BCL held the students overnight, and handed them over to the university administration on Monday morning.

Instructions of suicide bombing, and videos of terrorist activities were found in possession of the nine students, he claimed.

Director of the students' welfare department of BUET, Delwar Hossain, refused to comment on the incident. “Details in this matter will be revealed after further inquiry,” he said.
