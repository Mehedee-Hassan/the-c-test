Sushma for zero tolerance to terrorism in Bangladesh
India's external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj on Friday sent a letter to her Bangladesh counterpart AH Mahmood Ali stressing the necessity of a ‘comprehensive approach in fighting terrorism at all levels’.

“We need to adopt zero tolerance policy and a comprehensive approach in fighting terrorism at all levels,” Sushma wrote in the letter a copy of which UNB obtained.

The Indian minister said India stands “firmly” with Bangladesh in this hour of grief and will work ‘shoulder to shoulder’ with the government of Bangladesh against terrorism and protect societies of both countries from the threat of ideologies of hate, violence and terror.

“I am extremely pained at the news of innocent lives in the cowardly terrorist attack on Holey Artisan Bakery in Gulshan,” Sushma wrote.

She strongly condemned the attack and conveyed their heartfelt empathy and condolences to those who have lost their loved ones and wished those injured a speedy recovery.

“This has shown us that terrorism has no religion and no faith,” said the Indian external affairs minister mentioning that she is confident that the government of Bangladesh will do its utmost to bring those responsible for this cowardly attack to justice so that such attacks are not repeated in future.

It is ‘unfortunate’ that such mindless violence should be perpetrated during the holy month of Ramadan when minds of true believers would be turned to spiritual pursuits, she added.

Twenty-two people, including nine Italians, seven Japanese, one Indian national and two policemen were killed inside and outside the café during the attack on Friday.

Later on Saturday morning, six attackers were also killed during a commando operation. Thirteen of the hostages were rescued alive in that operation.
