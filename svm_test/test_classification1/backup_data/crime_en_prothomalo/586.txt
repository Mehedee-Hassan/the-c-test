A citizen of East Europe is suspected to be involved in recent ATM card forgery incidents as detectives have already identified 4-5 foreigners through scrutinising video footages.

“We have already identified 4-5 foreigners, hailed from East European countries, by scrutinising video footages. Of them, one might have involvement in the recent ATM cards forgery,” said DMP’s additional commissioner Monirul Islam on Wednesday.

Talking to reporters at DMP Media centre, Monirul however said the detectives have not arrested the suspect as they need to be completely sure as the man is a foreign national.



“But they (4-5 foreign nationals) are now under surveillance of the detectives,” he added.

The official said a case was filed with Banani police station in connection with ATM cards forgery. The case has already been transferred to the detective branch of police.

The additional commissioner said the detectives have also been investigating if local people, including bank employees and officials, are involved in the forgery.



On February 12 this month, authority of the United Commercial Bank (UCB) has filed the case with Banani Police station as at least Tk 1.26 lakh was misappropriated through several ATM cards forgery recently.

The Bangladesh Bank on Saturday asked several banks to block around 200 ATM cards as those are believed to have been read by “skimming devices” during 7-9 February.



Meanwhile, the central bank will hand over money among the ATM card holders of EBL, who were financially affected. The money will be given with the assistance of EBL.

Deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank Naznin Sultana is scheduled to be formally handed over the money at the conference room of the central bank on Thursday morning, according to an official.
