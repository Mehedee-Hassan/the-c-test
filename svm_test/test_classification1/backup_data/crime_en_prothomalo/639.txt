Washington eyes security coop with Dhaka
The United States is looking for ways to strengthen collaboration with Bangladesh in a number of areas including security, cyber-security, democratic rights, labor, and trade.





To that end, a number of US officials will be visiting Bangladesh in the coming weeks to discuss issues of mutual interest with Bangladeshi counterparts.

The US officials will be visiting in three separate groups, foreign ministry sources said.

A delegation, led by Thomas Dukes, deputy coordinator for cyber issues at the US state department, is scheduled to visit Dhaka on 22-23 March.

Dukes is responsible for cybercrime, cyber-security, national security and capacity building issues, as well as overall management of personnel, budget and strategic planning for the secretary’s office of the xoordinator of cyber issues.

Another delegation, led by Alan Bersin, assistant secretary for international affairs and chief diplomatic officer for the US homeland security department's office of oolicy, is scheduled to visit on 30-31 March, said the source.

Bersin oversees DHS’s international engagement, serves as the principal advisor to the Secretary in all matters pertaining to international affairs, and is responsible for leading the department’s strategic planning and policy formulation functions.

Meanwhile, US under-secretary for civilian security, democracy, and human rights Sarah Sewall is likely to visit Dhaka on 29 March-April 1, said a diplomatic source. She is a longtime advocate for advancing civilian security and human rights around the world.

Asked about the coming visits, US embassy spokesperson Nancy VanHorn told UNB that they expect that several US officials will visit Dhaka in the ‘coming weeks’ to work with their Bangladeshi partners on ways to strengthen collaboration in the areas of security, democratic rights, labor, and trade. She, however, did not name who are coming to Dhaka.

Nancy also said as the partnership between Bangladesh and the United States ‘grows’, they welcome a range of high level visitors who meet with their Bangladeshi counterparts to discuss issues such as security, democratic rights, labor, and trade.
