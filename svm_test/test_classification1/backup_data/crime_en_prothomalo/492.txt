FF certificates of 5 secretaries finally cancelled
The government has finally cancelled the freedom fighter certificates of five secretaries. However, if is yet to be known if any action will be taken against them, as recommended by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), for these obtaining these false certificates.

Following investigations, ACC sent a letter to the Ministry of Public Administration stating that these secretaries had arranged these certificates, even though they were not actually freedom fighters at all. ACC recommended that the certificates be cancelled and punitive measures be taken against them.

These officials are Health Secretary Niaz Uddin Miah; Secretary of Liberation War Affairs, recently made OSD, AH Masud Siddiqui; Public Service Commission Secretary AKM Amir Hossain; former Secretary of the Prime Minister's Office Mollah Wahiduzzaman (presently Chairman of the Privatisation Board with the rank of a state minister); and, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Liberation War Affairs (OSD), Abdul Kasem Talukdar.

Former Cabinet Secretary Akbar Ali Khan tells Prothom Alo that departmental action can be taken against these officials. Legal action can also be taken against them for fraud.

According to sources, an influential advisor of the Prime Minister had repeatedly contacted the Ministry of Liberation War Affairs, advising that they go slow on the issue of cancelling the certificates of these officials.

Renowned lawyer Shahdeen Malik says if investigations prove them to be guilty of such misdemeanour, they can even be dismissed from service.
