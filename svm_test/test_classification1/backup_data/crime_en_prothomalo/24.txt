Destiny chairman, MD get conditional bail
The High Court on Wednesday granted a six-month interim bail to detained Destiny Group managing director Rafiqul Amin and Destiny-2000 chairman Mohammad Hossain on conditions in two money-laundering cases filed by the Anti Corruption Commission.

An HC bench comprising Justice Md Ruhul Quddus and Justice Bhishmadev Chakrabortty passed the order after hearing a petition.

Barrister Ajmalul Hossain QC stood for the accused while deputy attorney general Nazibur Rahman represented the state and M Khurshid Alam Khan argued for the ACC.

Talking to reporters, Nazibur Rahman said the HC granted bail to them on the conditions that they would surrender their passports to court.

On July 31, 2012, the ACC filed two money-laundering cases against Destiny-2000 chairman M Hossain and group managing director Rafiqul Amin and 20 others on charge of misappropriating investors’ money amounting to Tk 3,285 crore.

ACC deputy director Mozahar Ali Sarder filed one case with Kalabagan Police Station against 12 officials of Destiny-2000, including its chairman and managing director, under the Money Laundering Act 2012 for allegedly misappropriating over Tk 2,106 crore from the Destiny Tree Plantation Limited (DTPL).

ACC assistant director Toufiqul Islam filed the other case with the same police station against 22 Destiny officials under the same act for alleged embezzlement of Tk 1,178 crore from the Destiny Multipurpose Cooperative Society Limited (DMCSL).

On May 4 this year, the ACC submitted charge-sheets before the court in the two cases.

The chairman and the MD of Destiny surrendered before a Dhaka court in connection with two cases seeking bail on October 11, 2012.
