Police yet to make arrest for DU sexual assault
Two and a half months since women were sexually assaulted during Pahela Baishakh celebrations on the Dhaka University campus, police are yet to make any arrests.

A departmental case was filed against a policeman and four others were cautioned for neglecting their duties during the assault. Nothing has been done beyond that.

On 14 April, a group of rowdy young men went around the campus, sexually assaulting women during Baishakhi celebrations on campus.

Several activists of Dhaka University Chhatra Union of Dhaka University were attacked too when they tried to protect the young women from the molesters.

The activists claimed that police released the two culprits they had caught red handed.

The police first were sceptical as to whether any such incident actually occurred. Going through CCTV footage, however, they identified eight people as the offenders.

An investigating officer of the case filed with Shahbag police station said, “We have been able to see the face of eight people and have published advertisements seeking their identities. However, no one has come up has so far with any information about them.”

“Only a few Chhatra Union students recorded their testimonies of the incident. There were no other witnesses to be found. Even, the victims remained silent about the incident,” the police officer added.

The probe committee of the incident found on-duty police guilty of not performing their duties. Following the probe report, we have filed a divisional case against sub-inspector Ashraful Alam and cautioned three others for neglecting their duties.”
