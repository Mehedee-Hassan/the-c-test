Everyone appreciates us except TIB: Nasim
Health minister Mohammad Nasim on Tuesday said everyone appreciates the works of health ministry other than Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB).

He said this while speaking as the chief guest at a workshop on cardiac care at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and Hospital (BSMMU).

Health minister said he went through the report of TIB where it is not said that the bribe was paid to whom or by whom, and it is baseless if they did not mention anyone.

"I don't support corruption and none is spared if found corrupt, whoever was proved corrupt, was removed," minister said.

Minister also demanded that no lobbying took place after he took charge of the ministry.

TIB published a report titled 'Challenge of good governance in health sector and ways of transition' where it said that transaction between Tk 10,000 to Tk 10 lakh takes place as bribe at different levels of health sector for transfers and promotions. The bribe is divided among the officials of health department, civil surgeons and ruling party leaders.
