Bail denied for Moudud, Khoka
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party leaders Moudud Ahmed and Sadek Hossain Khoka have been denied bail by two separate courts in Dkaka.

The courts on Monday also allowed the authorities concerned to quiz them at the jail gate.

The courts also remanded them in custody.

Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Ali Masud Sheikh ordered Moudud to be quizzed for three days in connection with a land grabbing case.

Meanwhile, Metropolitan Magistrate Mostafizur Rahman ordered the interrogation of Khoka within five days over charges, including vandalism, torching vehicle and blasting crude bomb at Jatrabari of the capital.
