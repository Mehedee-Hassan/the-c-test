Nizami's death penalty upheld
Supreme Court on Wednesday upholds death penalty of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami chief and former minister Matiur Rahman Nizami for crimes against humanity in 1971.



A 4-member Appellate Division bench, led by chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha, handed down the verdict.



Justices Nazmun Ara Sultana, Syed Mahmud Hossain and Hasan Foez Siddque are members of the bench.



On 8 December last, the Supreme Court fixed 6 January for delivering the verdict on the appeal filed by condemned convict Jamaat ameer Matiur Rahman Nizami.



Earlier, the defence placed their arguments on 30 November, 1 and 2 December while the prosecution completed submitting arguments on 8 December.



Earlier on 2 December, last, Nizami’s counsel Khandker Mahabub Hossain also prayed to the apex court for releasing him or giving him any other punishment instead of death penalty taking his age and physical condition into consideration.



On 29 October, 2014, the International Crimes Tribunal-1 sentenced Nizami to death for committing crimes against humanity, including genocide and the murder of intellectuals, during the Liberation War.



Nizami filed an appeal challenging the death sentence and claimed himself innocent and sought to be cleared of the charges on 23 November, 2014.
