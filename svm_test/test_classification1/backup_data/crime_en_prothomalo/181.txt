Tarique’s speech seditious: AL


Ruling Awami League termed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Tarique Rahman's comment on the country's first president "seditious".

Awami League's publicity and publication secretary Hasan Mahmud at a press conference in Dhaka on Thursday said, “Tarique Rahman’s speech on Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is seditious.”

The press conference was held at the party president's political office in Dhanmondi in Dhaka.

Hasan Mahmud said diplomatic procedure to bring back Tarique to Dhaka is underway.

Hasan said, "If (Tarique is) brave enough, come back to this country. Face the charges including corruption, money laundering, looting that were pressed against you by the people."

He also asked Tarique to read a book titled Bangabhabaner Satabarsher Itihash, before making any comment on the presidents of Bangladesh.

Earlier on Wednesday at an exchange of views with British-Bangladeshi civil society members at the Westminster Hall in London, Tarique said that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was an illegal prime minister in 1972 as his daughter Hasina is now.
