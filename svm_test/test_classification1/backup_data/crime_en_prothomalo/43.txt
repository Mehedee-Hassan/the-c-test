ACC quizzes 5 One Bank officials
The Anti-Corruption Commission on Monday questioned five One Bank officials, including its deputy managing director, in connection with the embezzlement of about Tk 1300 crore by Ananda Shipyard, a manufacturer and exporter of ships.

An ACC team, led by its deputy director Zainul Abedin Shebly, interrogated the bank officials for over two hours at the anti-graft body’s headquarters, ACC public relations officer Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya told Prothom Alo.

The officials are DMD Johora Bebe, Rozina Aliya Ahmed, Md Aftab Uddin Khan, Md Abu Saleh and Jamil Hossain.

Six more officials will be questioned on Wednesday. They are senior vice president Asif Mahmud Khan, senior principal officer Mahbub Hasan, principal officers Md Anisuzzaman and Khaled Al Fesani, Motijheel branch in-charge Muztaba M Kazmi and officer Abu Shahadat Md Shahed.

ACC sources said these officials were directly or indirectly responsible for sanctioning loans worth over Tk 114 crore to Ananda Shipyard from the Motijheel branch of One Bank.

Ananda Shipyard has embezzled over Tk 1300 crore from 14 different banks in the name of ship export.

Although Ananda Shipyard did not have prior experience of ship export or enough collateral, such big loans were granted. After Bangladesh Bank found irregularities in its inspections, the incident of embezzlement came to the fore, the sources said.

The ACC started the investigation in April last year.
