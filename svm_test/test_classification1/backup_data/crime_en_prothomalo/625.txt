Elderly couple killed in road crash
An elderly couple was killed as a speeding car hit the two in Dhaka's Shewrapara area on Wednesday morning.



Ataur Rahman, 70, and Rawshan Ara, 60, were standing in front of Haji Ashraf Ali Market when the accident took place. They were going to their daughter's home at Mohammadpur.



Witnesses said they saw three youths running away leaving the car after the accident. Bottles of alcohol were found in the car, which suggests they were probably drunk.



The locals said there were three young men inside the car. The car was running too fast that it took Rawshan Ara almost 20 feet away from where she was standing.



They also said police had let the miscreants go although they caught them after the incident.



Kafrul police station sub-inspector Ferdous said there was no traffic sergeant there at that time.



He also said family of the deceased will file a case after burial.



When asked about the identity cards that were found inside the car, he said "We haven’t got them yet. There were other police teams there. Some of them might have taken them."



"We have got the number of the car. It will help us run our investigation," he added.
