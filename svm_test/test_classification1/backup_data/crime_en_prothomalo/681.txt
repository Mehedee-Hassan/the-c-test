Transport strike in Sylhet continues
Workers of the rest modes of transport on Tuesday extended their support for the ongoing strike enforced by the truck, pick-up van and covered van workers to press home their five-point demand.



The strike called by Sylhet District Road Transport Shramik Union on December 12 at a press briefing started on December 13.

The five-point demand includes arrangement of an alternative stand for microbus, end to harassment of drivers through random requisition of cars and by filing false cases against them and removal of corrupt traffic police officials and bringing an end to excessive toll collection.



Contacted, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Sylhet Metropolitan Police Rahmat Ullah said the higher authorities of the district was informed of the matter.



Decision will be taken as per the directive of the authorities, he added.
