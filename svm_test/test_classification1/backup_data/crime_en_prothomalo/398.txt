A regional leader of the outlawed party Ganobahini was killed in a reported gunfight with police in Housing Mondal Filing Station area of the district town early Wednesday.

The deceased was identified as Amirul Islam, son of Jaber, a resident of Sonaidanga village under the Islamic University police station.

Sabbirul Islam, officer-in-charge of Kushtia Detective Branch (DB) of police, said acting on secret information that a gang of outlawed party men was taking preparation to commit robbery on the Kushtia-Rajbari road by placing logs in the area, a team of police conducted a drive there 2:15 am.

Sensing the presence of police, Amirul along with his accomplices opened fire on them, prompting the law enforcers to fire back, triggering a gunfight.

At one stage, Amirul was caught in the line of fire and injured while his accomplices managed to flee the scene.

Later, police arrested Amirul and rushed him to Kushtia General Hospital where doctors declared him dead.

Four policemen were injured during the gunfight.

Police recovered four firearms, some sharp weapons and some rounds of bullet from the spot.

Amirul was wanted in several cases, including for murder and kidnapping, the OC added.
