The authorities of a Savar garments factory on Saturday morning sacked 67 of its workers over vandalism and arson attack in the name of movement.

The authorities of FCI (BD) Garments Limited in Dhaka Export Processing Zone hanged the names and photos of the accused 67 workers on the notice board.

Security guards of the factory also obstructed them while entering the factory.
