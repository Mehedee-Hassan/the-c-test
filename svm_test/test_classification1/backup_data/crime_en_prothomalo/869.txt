Bribery increases in country: TIB
Passport office and the law enforcement agencies are the two most corrupt institutions in the country in terms of taking bribes, said a survey of Transparency International, Bangladesh (TIB) on Wednesday.



The Bangladesh chapter of Berlin-based international anti-corruption body released the survey report at a press conference at its Dhanmondi office.



Education sector, transport authority, land administration, judicial service and electricity follow the two, in the government's services sector, where the people have to pay bribes.



The survey found that in 2015 alone the graft money amounted to at least Tk 8,822 crore, which is 1,500 crore higher than the bribed money that changed hands.



The poor were found to have suffered most in getting services compared to the people in the higher income bracket.



The TIB carried out the survey titled "Corruption in Service Sector National Household Report 2015", following a similar survey in 2012.



Almost 77 per cent of the people who needed services at the passport department suffered because of corruption, said the survey.



In terms of volume of bribe, the land office has topped the list. When it comes to the amount of each case of bribe, the gas supply office stands first with more than Tk 27,000 bribe for a single case.



The survey also tried to explain why people paid bribes. The reasons include getting access to services, lack of information, avoiding harassment, timely services and speedy services in cases.



TIB chairperson Sultana Kamal, executive director Iftekharuzzaman and deputy executive director Sumaiya Khayer spoke, among others, on the occasion.
