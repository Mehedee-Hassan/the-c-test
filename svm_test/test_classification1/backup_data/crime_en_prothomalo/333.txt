US offers Bangladesh help to fight terrorism
The United States has put emphasis on “better understanding” with Bangladesh to counter terrorism, offering assistance to combat terrorism and violent extremism.



“We're ready to help Bangladesh in fighting terrorism and violent extremism by providing experts and technical supports,” US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs Nisha Desai Biswal said on Thursday, according to state-run news agency BSS.

The US official made the offer when she paid a courtesy call on prime minister Sheikh Hasina at her office on Thursday morning.

The premier's press secretary Ihsanul Karim briefed newsmen about the meeting.





The prime minister and the US Assistant Secretary of State discussed the issue of recent secret killings in Bangladesh, he said.

Expressing concern over recent killings in Bangladesh, Biswal said the USA and Bangladesh could share information over combating terrorism and violent extremism.





While talking about the issue of terrorism, she said Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina has personal sacrifice and experience in combating terrorism.





“She (prime minister) herself a victim of terrorism as her most of the family members were assassinated in the 15 August carnage in 1975,” she said.

The US assistant secretary of state stressed the need for strengthening community policing system and expressed satisfaction over stepping up security measures by the Bangladesh government for safety of the US embassy staff.





Biswal invited prime minister Sheikh Hasina to co-chair a high-level event on migration with US president Barack Obama to be held in the UN headquarters in New York during the 71st UN General Assembly in September.
