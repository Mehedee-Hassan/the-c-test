Mirza Fakhrul freed on bail
BNP acting secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir was freed Tuesday evening on bail.

Freed from the prison cell of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Mirza Fakhrul told newsmen he would soon go abroad for better treatment.

The BNP leader also sought the blessings of his countrymen so that he could come back home soon to serve the nation.

Earlier on Monday, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court’s decision in favour of Mirza Fakhrul’s bail for six weeks on medical grounds in three vandalism and arson cases, and said he can also go abroad if needed for better treatment during the bail period.

A four-member bench of the Appellate Division led by chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha passed the order.

The SC order cleared way to Fakhrul’s release from jail.

The court came up with the order after acting attorney general Murad Reza submitted a report on the health condition of the BNP leader from the BSMMU.

The report said that Fakhrul is suffering from vascular disease and needs better treatment.
