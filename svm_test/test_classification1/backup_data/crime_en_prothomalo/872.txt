Canadian court frees ex-Lavalin execs in Padma case
Three former top executives of SNC-Lavalin have been acquitted in Padma Bridge bribery case, reports CBCNews.

AN Ontario Superior Court justice, Canada, on Friday reportedly acquitted Kevin Wallace, Ramesh Shah, and Zulfiquar Ali Bhuiyan at the prosecution’s request.

Last month, Superior Court justice Ian Nordheimer ruled that wiretap evidence had to be excluded, according to CBCNews.

Quoting a prosecution spokesperson, it added that the prosecution on Friday elected to call no evidence and the accused were acquitted.

The allegations of corruption led suspension of financing of the Padma Bridge by the World Bank and exit of a cabinet minister.
