ACC okays charge sheet against Rupali Bank DGM
Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) has approved a charge-sheet against seven people, including a deputy general manager of Rupali Bank, on charge of swindling Tk 69 lakh from the bank.

The commission approved the charge sheet at its regular meeting on Thursday, ACC public relations officer Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya said on Friday.

The charge sheet will be submitted against suspended deputy general manager Kabir Ahmad of Rupali Bank (foreign trade corporate branch), its former senior principal officer Ashrafuzzaman, owner of Nurjahan Garments Nazrul Islam, Haji Kalachan Bhuiyan, Nurjahan Begum, Syed M Rezaul Haider and Iftekhar Alam Farid of Narayanganj.

During the ACC investigation, it was found that the accused in collusion with each other plundered the money from Rupali Bank through opening back-to-back letters of credit (LCs) in the name of a fake business firm.

On December 31, 2013, a case was filed with Motijheel Police Station in connection with the fraud.
