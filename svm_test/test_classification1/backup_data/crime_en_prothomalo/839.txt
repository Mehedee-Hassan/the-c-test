Cop faces action for demanding bribe from HC judge's wife
The High Court on Wednesday ordered the authorities concerned to take departmental action against a Special Branch of police official for demanding bribe to the wife of an HC judge for passport verification.

A single-member HC bench of Justice Quazi Reza-Ul Hoque also ordered filing of a case against SB assistant sub-inspector Sadiqul Islam under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The home secretary, IGP and SB additional police super have been directed to take the departmental action.

Meanwhile, the accused police officer was handed over to police after a case was filed against him with Shahbagh police station.

Court sources said SB sub-inspector Abdus Salam was assigned for verifying the passports of two children of a High Court judge.

However, he sent ASI Sadiqul to the judge’s Dhanmondi house for the verification on Tuesday when Sadiqul introduced him as SI Salam and demanded Tk 2,000 to the judge’s wife for the verification.

The wife informed the judge of the matter and asked the police officer to go away.

Following the HC order, ASI Sadiqul appeared before the court on Wednesday morning when he introduced him as SI Salam and confessed to demanding the bribe.

Later, the HC passed the order and the police officer was handed over to police.
