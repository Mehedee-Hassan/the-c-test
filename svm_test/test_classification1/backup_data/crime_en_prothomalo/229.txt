Staff Correspondent

The High Court today stayed a lower court order to quiz Bangladesh Bar Council vice-chairman Khandker Mahbub Hossain for seven days.

A HC bench of justice Enayetur Rahim and justice Mohammad Ullah on Thursday issued the order.

Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Aminul Haque on Wednesday gave police two days to interrogate Khandker Mahbub to find out whether he was involved in a series of vandalism and instigation for bomb attacks last month. The court also remanded him on jail.

The HC also issued a rule on the government to explain within seven days why the lower court order, which sent Khaleda Zia's adviser Mabhub to custody to be questioned, should not be cancelled.

Khandker Mahbub's lawyers Golam Mohammad Chaudhury Alal and Golam Kibria and assistant attorney general Md Mamunur Rashid confirmed the stay order to Prothom Alo.

DB on Tuesday detained Khandker Mahbub from the National Press Club.
