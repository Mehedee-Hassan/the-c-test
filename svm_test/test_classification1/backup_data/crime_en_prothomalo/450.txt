Ghadanik demands BNP’s apology
Ekattarer Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee (Ghadanik) on Tuesday demanded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) seek apology to the nation for its chief’s recent remarks on the number of liberation war martyrs.

The civic platform, which campaigns for annihilation of killers and collaborators of the Pakistani occupation force in 1971, raised the demand on Tuesday in a statement, signed by, among others, organisation’s president Golam Rabbani, acting president Shahriar Kabir, vice-president Muntasir Mamun, general secretary Kazi Mukul and sculptor Ferdousi Priyabhashini.

At a discussion in the city earlier on Monday, BNP chief Khaleda Zia said there is a debate over the actual number of martyrs during the country’s Liberation War.

“Once again Khaleda Zia has proved that she is still loyal to Pakistan as she was to Pakistani occupation force in 1971, by denying the established government statistics of the number of martyrs,” read the statement.

The statement claimed that the international media and agencies put the figure of martyrs in 1971 at three million. “But, Pakistan and its collaborators who had committed the genocide during the war have always denied the statistics.”
