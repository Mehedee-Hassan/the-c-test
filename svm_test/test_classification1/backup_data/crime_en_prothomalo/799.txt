Arafat Sunny sent to jail
A Dhaka court on Tuesday sent national cricketer Arafat Sunny to jail rejecting his bail pleas in a case filed under the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act.



Metropolitan magistrate Mohammad Jakir Hossain Tipu passed the order when police produced him before his court on completion of his one-day remand.



The court turned down the bail petition of the spinner when his lawyer Jewel Ahmed moved it, reports UNB.

Earlier on Sunday, metropolitan magistrate Pranab Kumar put Arafat Sunny on a one-day remand in the case filed by Nasrin Sultana, who claims to be Sunny’s wife.

Police arrested the national cricketer from Aminbazar area of Savar upazila on 22 January.

Meanwhile, Nasrin filed another case on Monday against Arafat Sunny and his mother Nargis Akter on charge of demanding Tk 20 lakh as dowry.
