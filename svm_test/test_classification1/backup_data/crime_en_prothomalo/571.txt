University teacher fired for forging certificates
Begum Rokeya University have dismissed a teacher for getting the job using forged certificates.

The university syndicate, chaired by vice-chancellor AKM Nurun Nabi, on Saturday also decided to sue the finance and banking lecturer Abu Jafar Mohammad Imran for the forgery.

University officials said that Mohammad Imran was recruited as a lecturer under finance and banking department and he joined the post on March 11, 2014.

He submitted academic certificates in which he claimed that he completed his master's degree from the finance and banking department of Rajshahi University on February 3 this year.

After his appointment, rumors sparked on the Rokeya University campus that he got the job using forged certificates.

The university department got an anonymous letter that claimed that Mohammad Imran had forged his BBA and MBA certificates.

Later, Imran resigned from his post showing personal reasons on April 23. Since then he could not be traced.

Prothom Alo on April 28 published a report on Imran's forgery.

The Rokeya University authorities asked the Rajshahi University administration for authentic information on Imran's results.

In reply, the RU registrar said that Imran secured CGPA 2.73 in his BBA final exams though Imran in his forged certificates claimed that he got 3.63 out of 4 scale. Imran also claimed that he secured CGPA 3.54 in MBA, however, the RU registrar informed that Imran got admissions to the finance and banking department in 2001-02 session and he did not completed his MBA yet. He just got 2.60 in the MBA first semester examinations, 2006, that were held in 2008.

Rokeya University vice-chancellor Nurun Nabi and public relations officer Mohammad Ali confirmed Prothom Alo that the university syndicate dismissed Imran for the forgery and the university authorities were likely to file a lawsuit against him.
