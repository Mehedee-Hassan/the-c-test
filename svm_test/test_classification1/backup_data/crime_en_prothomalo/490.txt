Movement if municipal polls rigged: BNP
BNP senior leader Hafizuddin Ahmed on Sunday warned that the party will take to the streets against the election commission (EC) if the 30 December municipal elections are plagued with vote fraud and manipulation.



“There’ll be no change in the government through the municipal polls. We hope the government will hold a fair election for the sake of democracy. Our chairperson will call for a movement against the election commission before the government if the election is not held fairly,” he said.



Hafiz, a BNP vice chairman, issued the threat at a discussion at the Jatiya Press Club arranged by all Community Forum, a pro-BNP platform.



He alleged that the government is making a blueprint to manipulate the polls. “We would like to tell the EC to stand on its own feet and take action against those try to create chaos in the polls and ensure that no one can be elected flexing muscle.”

The BNP leader alleged that the BNP candidates and their supporters cannot carry out electioneering in many municipalities due to obstruction and intimidation by the ruling party men.

He also criticised the government for arresting BNP leaders and activists and implicating them in ‘false’ cases on the occasion of the polls.

He urged law enforcers to play a neutral role and take proper action against the troublemakers.
