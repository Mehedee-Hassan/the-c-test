FBI team visits Avijit murder site
The four-member team of US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which arrived Dhaka on Wednesday to assist the Bangladeshi law enforcement agencies to investigate the murder case of blogger and writer Avijit Roy, visited the murder site on Friday.

The team reached the place of occurrence around 1:35pm and took photographs there. They also visited Suhrawardy Udyan and Bangla Academy areas where the Ekushey book fair was arranged.

“The FBI team will provide technical support for the investigation into the murder of Avijit Roy,” said Krishnapad Roy, the DC of Detective Branch of Police (South), while talking to reporters at the murder site.

“The team will work alongside the law enforcement agencies of the country,” he added.

Earlier on Thursday, the FBI team held a three-hour meeting with the detectives at the DB headquarters at Mintoo Road.

Blogger and writer Avijit Roy was killed and his wife Rafida Afrin Banya injured seriously as unidentified criminals stabbed them near TSC on the Dhaka University campus on February 26.

Avijit and Rafida, an expatriate couple living in the USA, returned home a few days ahead of the brutal incident as his two books were published on the occasion of Amar Ekushey Book Fair.

Spokesperson of the US Embassy in Dhaka Monica L Shie told UNB on Tuesday that the FBI will deploy a small team to Bangladesh shortly.

Monica particularly said the FBI can provide valuable technical assistance with regard to transnational aspects of the investigation.

Earlier, the government decided to positively respond to the US’ offer to engage the FBI in unearthing the motive and real culprits behind the murder of writer and blogger Avijit Roy.
