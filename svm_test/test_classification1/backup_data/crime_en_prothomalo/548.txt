Govt to send manpower to KSA
After the recent withdrawal of ban on hiring Bangladeshi workers by Saudi authorities, Dhaka will ensure manpower exports to the Arab country under official arrangement.

However, expatriate welfare and overseas employment minister Khankder Mosharraf Hossain said on Monday that the private recruiting agents will be able to join the government efforts.

"It will take no more than Tk 15,000-Tk 20,000 to send a worker to Saudi Arabia," he said after a delegation of the Saudi government met him at his office.

A 16-member team from the oil-rich country arrived in Dhaka on Sunday to discuss with the officials and stakeholders the process of sending Bangladeshi workers to that country in a transparent and hassle-free manner.

Ahmed F Alfahaid, Saudi deputy minister for international affairs at the labour ministry, is leading the delegation.

The government of Bangladesh earlier initiated the process of exporting manpower to Malaysia but that had not been very successful.

Asked if the process will be successful in Saudi Arabia's case, the Bangladesh minister said the government had to take the initiative following allegations of forgery and cheating.

"The government will actually regulate the process and the private sector will take part in the process," he added.
