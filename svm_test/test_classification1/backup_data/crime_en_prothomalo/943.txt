Miscreants kill child, loot house
Miscreants have strangulated a 10-year-old schoolgirl and looted cashes, ornaments and valuables after storming into a house in Narayanganj town's Jamtala Dhupapatti area on Thursday afternoon.

The deceased, Sonali Das, is a grade four student of the Masdair Government Primary School. She was living with her parents.

Sonali's mother Mala Rani Das said she went to a local branch of Sonali Bank to deposit money. Her two other daughters were in the school. Sonali was alone in the house as her class was scheduled to be held in the afternoon. When Mala was at the bank branch, she came to know that Sonali's body was hanging inside the house.

Mala rushed to the house and found Almirah ransacked and cashes, ornaments, and valuables missing. Sonali was rushed to the Narayanganj 300-bed Hospital where doctors declared her dead.

Fatulla police station assistant superintendent Md Sharfuddin said that the body was sent to the Narayanganj General Hospital morgue for autopsy. She was strangulated and bore marks of injuries in the back of her head. Police were trying to identify and arrest the criminals.
