ACC arrests BB GM over loan scam
The Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) on Sunday arrested a general manager of Bangladesh Bank (accounts and audit) and another accused for their alleged involvement in the embezzlement of Tk 325 crore in loans from AB Bank.



An ACC team, led by its director AKM Jahid Hossain Khan, arrested BB general manager Badrul Haque Khan from the capital, ACC public relations officer Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya told UNB.



Another team of the Commission detained director of Rising Steel Mills Jasim Uddin from Chittagong in connection with the graft allegation.



On Saturday night, deputy assistant director of the ACC’s Chittagong Office Manik Lal Das filed a case with Double Mooring Police Station in Chittagong against six people, including BNP leader Aslam Chowdhury and Badrul Haque Khan (then deputy managing director of AB Bank), for allegedly swindling out Tk 325 crore from the private bank.



Other accused of the case are former managing director of AB Bank Fazlur Rahman, chairman of Rising Steel Mills Jamila Naznin Mowla (also wife of Aslam Chowdhury), managing director of the steel mills Amjad Hossain Chowdhury and its director Jasim Uddin.



According to the first information report (FIR), Rising Steel Mills earlier took loans of Tk 325 crore from Agrabad branch of the AB Bank opening letters of credits (LCs) through fake documents. Later, all the accused in collusion with each other swindled out the amount from the bank.



BNP leader Aslam Chowdhury is now in jail in a treason case.
