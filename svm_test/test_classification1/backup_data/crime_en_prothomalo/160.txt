Around 300 facing criminals charges got bail before Eid
Dhaka courts released around 300 convicts on bail on the occasion of the Eid-ul-Fitr, some of the released being people charged with murder.

The convicts’ lawyers pleaded for their bails arguing that Eid was round the corner. Even the court order for the bails detailed that the bails were being granted considering that “Eid was knocking at the door”.



On 30 June, the last working day of the courts before the Eid, 293 convicts were let out on bail. Among them, 263 got bail from the chief metropolitan magistrate's court while a further 30 got bail from the Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge's court.

Sources in the courts said the number of bails given is far greater than usual.



Police’s crime and information department documents show most of the convicts let out on 30 June were charged with cases related to narcotics. Besides, convicts charged with murder, rape, theft, burglary, kidnapping and human trafficking got bail as well.



“Dangerous criminals, murderers, rapists and drug dealers should not be let out with the excuse of Eid. This will put victims and their families in danger,” says Kislu Shah Alam, additional assistant of Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge's court.



Many plaintiffs in cases are now worried about their safety. It has been alleged that many have been threatened to withdraw their cases after the convicts are re-imprisoned.



According to case files, on 8 May 2015, a youth named Rubel Hossain was shot dead in the capital's Badda area. His mother Nasima Akter later filed a murder case and one Omar Faruk Alias Picchi Al Amin was arrested on 1 September 2015 to this end. Omar Faruk has been charged with 10 different cases related to murder, illegal arms, narcotics and extortion as well, but he did get a bail from the Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge's court.
