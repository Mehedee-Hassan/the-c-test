TI ranks Bangladesh 13th most corrupt country
Bangladesh has ranked 13th among the most corrupt countries in the world, said Transparency International (TI) in its world Corruption Perception Index (CPI).



Bangladesh scored 25 points to end at 13th among 168 countries in the ranking. Last year, Bangladesh ranked 14th scoring the same points among 175 countries.



Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) Executive Director Iftekharuzzaman said strong political will to fight corruption is a must and institutions of accountability and rule of law must be allowed to function independently and effectively, also free from partisan influence.



He said this while speaking at a press conference on the release of TI’s CPI 2015 at its Dhanmondi office on Wednesday.



Iftekharuzzaman also said a conducive environment must be created for people at large, particularly media, civil society, and NGOs to raise and strengthen the demand for accountability.



The TIB executive director said some high profile corruption scandals like Sonali Bank, Basic Bank, Destiny group, Rana Plaza, and the stock market have lowered the level of public trust on the prospect of getting justice.



He further said that the ACC is also believed to have not demonstrated the professionalism and capacity befitting its mandate and expectation for its part in curbing the corruption.



According to CPI 2015, Bangladesh is the second worst performer in South Asia, better than only Afghanistan, which has scored 11, ranked 166th, the second lowest globally.



All other South Asian countries - Bhutan, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal have scored more and ranked higher than Bangladesh in that order. At the lowest position in the global list are Somalia and North Korea, having scored 8 points each.



Iftekharuzzaman said the denial syndrome in a section of the political authority has prevented the prospect of accountability feeding into a culture of impunity. He said people with direct or indirect links with power have continued unauthorized capture of land, forest, river and water bodies and the practice of loan-default.



Denmark has been ranked the top among the countries perceived to be least affected by corruption for the second successive year having scored 91 followed by Finland (90), New Zealand (89), Netherlands and Norway (87), Switzerland (86), Singapore (85), Canada (83), and Germany, Luxembourg and UK (81). Other than Singapore, only Japan, Hong Kong, Qatar and UAE have scored 70 or more.



Bangladesh was earlier placed at the bottom of the list for five successive years from 2001-2005. In 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 Bangladesh was ranked at no 3, 7, 10, 13, and 12 respectively. In 2011 and 2012 Bangladesh ranked 13th, 16th in 2013, and 14th in 2014.
