‘25,000 Bangladeshis, Rohingyas trafficked in 2015’
An estimated 25000 Bangladeshis and Rohingyas boarded people smugglers’ boats in the first three months of this year, twice as many in the same months of 2014, the UN refugee agency UNHCR said in a statement on Friday. The UNHCR report pointed out that in the first quarter of 2015, 25,000 people are estimated to have departed in irregular maritime movements from the Bay of Bengal.

The departure rate in the first quarter of 2015 was approximately double the departure rate reported in the first quarters of 2013 and 2014, the report added.

“Based on survivor accounts, we estimate that 300 people died at sea in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of starvation, dehydration and abuse by boat crews,” it said.

The smuggling route takes migrants from Myanmar and Bangladesh to southern Thailand.
