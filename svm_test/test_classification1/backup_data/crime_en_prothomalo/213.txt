'Country governing under a person's whimsical misrule'
Condemning the jailing of two top Bangladesh Nationalist Party leaders by a lower court, the party chairperson Khaleda Zia on Sunday said the country has gone under the grip of one person’s ‘whimsical and barbaric’ misrule.

“The country is now under one individual’s whimsical and barbaric misrule instead of the rule of law. The opposition leaders and activists and common people have been the victims of the misrule,” she said in a statement.

Earlier in the day, a Dhaka court sent BNP standing committee members Gayeshwar Chandra Roy and its joint secretary general to jail after rejecting their bail petitions in a case filed in connection with the killing of an Islami Chhatra Shibir activist on 29 December 2013.

Protesting the court order, Khaleda said the ruling party has turned out to be a great monoester as it crossed all the limits of autocracy. “There’s no security of public life and property. The country is passing through a critical juncture as frustration and anarchy are everywhere.”

She claimed that the government has snatched the opposition people’s rights to justice after ‘illegally implicating them in false and fabricated cases’.

The BNP chief said the government has exposed its evil intention and wild vengeance by jailing the two BNP leaders.

“Repression, killing, filing false case, forced disappearances, threat, slander and blatant lies are the only resort of the current illegal regime to hang onto power,” she added.

She alleged that the current illegal government after getting completely isolated from people has turned the country’s all organs, including the police administration, into the ruling party’s associate bodies in a bid to subdue the opposition and make its narrow political gains.

Khaleda demanded the government immediately release the two leaders after withdrawing the ‘false’ cases filed against them.
