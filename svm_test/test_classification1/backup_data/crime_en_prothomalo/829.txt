Housewife chopped dead over dowry
A housewife was chopped to death allegedly by her husband over dowry at Utra Hajipur village in Raiganj upazila of Sirajganj early Sunday.

The deceased was Munni Khatun,25, mother of one child and wife of Shariful Islam, a resident of the same village.

Rashedul Islam Biswas, officer-in-charge of Raiganj Police Station, said Munni had got married with Shariful about four years back.

Shariful received a dowry of Tk one lakh from Munni’s family at the time of marriage.

Recently, he raised a demand for more dowry money from the victim's parents.

As her parents failed their inability to meet the demand, he started inflicting inhuman torture on her.

On Saturday night, Shariful chopped Munni indiscriminately, leaving her dead on the spot.

Police recovered the body on Sunday morning and sent it to hospital morgue for an autopsy.

However, Shariful went into hiding after the killing.

A case was filed in this connection.
