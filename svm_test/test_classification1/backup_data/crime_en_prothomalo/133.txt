'Migrated maids vulnerable to abuse'
Bangladeshi women who migrate for domestic work are particularly vulnerable to abuse, said a US government’s report released in Washington on Monday.

The Trafficking in Persons Report (July 2015) said some women and children are subjected to commercial sexual exploitation and forced labour in India and Pakistan.

It mentioned allegations of some NGOs about instances of officials on both sides of the India-Bangladesh border allowing human traffickers to operate.

It further said Bangladesh government does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking though it is making significant efforts to do so.

The government continued to prepare, but did not finalise, the working rules for the Prevention and Suppression of Human Trafficking Act (PSHTA) 2012 in the last year.

It identified the government lacked a formal mechanism to refer trafficking victims to protective services.

The authorities rescued 2,621 victims and placed in nine government-operated shelters.

Before their departure, many migrant workers collect debt to pay high recruitment fees, imposed legally by recruitment agencies belonging to the Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA) and illegally by unlicensed sub-agents.

Some recruitment agencies and agents also commit recruitment fraud, including contract switching, in which they promise one type of job and conditions, but then change the job, employer, conditions, or salary after arrival.
