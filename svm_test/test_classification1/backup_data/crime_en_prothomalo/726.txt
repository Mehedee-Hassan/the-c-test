'Terrorism a serious threat to Bangladesh security'
Bangladesh’s chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha on Monday said terrorism has become a serious threat to the national security, PTI reports from Gandhinagar.

Justice Sinha reportedly stressed the urgent need to curb the activities of terrorist groups such as IS.

His statement came in the wake of recent killings of two foreign nationals in Bangladesh within one week and reported claim of responsibility by the Islamic State (IS).

In his speech at Gujarat National Law University (GNLU), the chief justice stressed that time has come for the entire world to stand together to fight ISIS and other forms of terrorism.

"We (Bangladesh) are trying hard to combat terrorism. It is a global issue, which India and Bangladesh are facing at the same time. Terrorism has become a major problem now," he was quoted to have said. He mentioned that ISIS was behind several acts, such as burning of Jordanian pilot, mass slaughter, beheading, stoning, etc.

“In Bangladesh, terrorism has become a serious threat to our national security. It has become a threat to life, economy and political as well as religious pluralism in Bangladesh,” Justice SK Sinha was quoted as saying.

"Incidents of religious assassination, political violence and bombings in some parts have stunned the nation. Similar eventualities are faced by India, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir," the chief justice said, according the PTI report published by The Economic Times.

Bangladesh has been fighting terrorism in various forms, such as drug trafficking. "Bangladesh always supports this global war against terrorism. Our government is trying hard to establish a sense of security among citizens," he was quoted to have said.
