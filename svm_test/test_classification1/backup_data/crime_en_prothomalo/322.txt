Kasimpur jail awaits Khaleda: Inu
Information minister Hasanul Haq Inu said Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief Khaleda Zia would be tried and imprisoned in Kasimpur jail.

He was speaking at a seminar organised by Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) on "Uprooting terrorism-arson attacks: Progression of democracy”, at the Colonel Taher auditorium in the capital on Friday.

Criticising the BNP chief for attending an Iftar party hosted by Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, Inu said, “This proves how close she is with Jamaat. She is not capable of changing.”

“Whether terrorism can have a place in democracy is a vital question today. Similarly, whether Khaleda should have a place in politics is another matter of concern,” he said

Terming Khaleda the “root of terrorism”, Inu said, “Chopping off the branches of terrorism will be of no avail if we do not weed out the root.”

He said that Khaleda would not be given the chance to implement Taleban-style politics in Bangladesh. “If we are supposed to show zero tolerance towards terrorism, we have to show zero tolerance to Khaleda,” the minister noted.

Coordinator of the Dhaka city unit of JSD Mir Hossain Akhter presided over the seminar. JSD general secretary Sharif Nurul Ambia, Nazmul Haque Pradhan MP, Nader Choudhury and Afroza Haque also spoke on the occasion.
