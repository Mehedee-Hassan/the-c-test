"No terrorist act on BD soil"
Bangladesh will never allow its territory, not even an inch, for any terrorist or militant outfits operating from India and Myanmar, said State Minister for Home Affairs Asaduzzaman Khan on Wednesday.

The state minister came up with the remark while giving his reaction to Monday’s report published in the Times of India stating that two Bangladeshis - Shamim Shakil Ahmed and Swapan alias Subhan Mandal-- were killed in a grenade explosion at a house in Burdwan town of West Bengal on October 2 ‘while making bombs’.

“We’re not sure that the slain alleged duo terrorists are the citizens of Bangladesh as claimed by the Indian daily. If it is so, we’ll take measures as Bangladesh never allows its land to be used by any militant or terrorist outfits operating from India or Myanmar,” Asaduzzaman said.

Besides, the junior minister said, “The Indian government is yet to inform us officially in this regard. A contact might take place within a day or two.”

Asad said the government would take measures after receiving official response from India. “Now we’re awaiting their response.”

Mentioning the celebrations of the two great festivals of Muslims and Hindus -- the Eid-ul-Azha and the Durga Puja -- Asaduzzaman said both the communities have celebrated their religious festivals in peace and harmony across the country. There had been no incident of snatching at hats and bazaars and robbery on roads, except a few minor crimes, during the festivals.
