Ex-consul general in NY sued for abusing worker
A former domestic worker for the ex-consul general of Bangladesh to New York has sued him and his wife for fraud and atrocity.



Worker Masud Parvez Rana filed the lawsuit in Manhattan Federal Court in New York on Friday against ex-consul general Monirul Islam and his wife Fahima Prabha.



Masud complained that the couple took him to the United States with false promises of $3,000 monthly wages, which were never paid, and they forced him to work in oppressive conditions.



He said employers kept him confined inside the house after taking away his passport. They threatened that he might have been caught by the police if he went out of the house without the passport.



He also complained that he was forced to work for about 18 hours each day starting from 6:00am. He was never paid the wages he was promised in last 18 months.



Attorney Dana Sussman works for Masud Parvez.



Monirul Islam has already been transferred to Morocco as an ambassador and was timetabled to left New York by this week.



Monirul Islam, however, brushed aside all complaints. He said Masud left the house few days ago and never returned. They tried to find him out, but failed. Masud was from Muradnagar of Comilla. Monirul claimed that his family paid a total of Tk 12 lakh to Masud’s father Nasir Uddin before Masud was sent to USA.
