Govt official suspended for taking bribe
M Shahidul Haque, Dhaka Controller of the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports (CCIE) office, has been suspended for taking bribe.



Commerce secretary Hedayetullah Al Mamun told this to Prothom Alo on Tuesday.



The CCIE official under the commerce ministry was seen counting illegal payments smilingly and even bargaining with businessmen for money in five video clips which were filmed secretly.



President of the country gave permission for investigation against the government official.



Earlier on 11 October, the authorities concerned transferred Shahidul Haque after a Prothom Alo report titled ‘govt official caught taking bribe’ was published on 9 October.



Shahidul began his career as a civil servant in 1985. Before CCIE, he served the government in important posts of the commerce ministry, tariff commission and Export Promotion Bureau (EPB).
