Police, not ACC, to handle private fraud cases
Private fraud and forgery cases will be excluded from the sections of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) Act.

From now on, police will handle the fraud cases.

However, ACC will handle the cases involving government property and the fraud charges against government officials and bank officials.

The draft of ACC (Amendment) Act-2015 has been approved on principle at the cabinet meeting on Monday.

Briefing reporters after the meeting, Cabinet secretary M Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan said it is troublesome for ACC to resolve thousands of fraud cases.

Police show reluctance to take fraud cases as ACC is entitled to take care of these cases, he added.

The secretary said the fraud cases will be transferred to the judicial court form special courts. The complainants can resubmit their complaints to the police.
