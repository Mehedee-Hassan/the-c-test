ACC asks for LGED project documents
The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has asked the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) to submit to the graft body documents of various projects implemented in the last three years.

ACC deputy director Mahbubul Alam sent a letter to the LGED chief engineer on Monday to send the documents by 29 March.

Sources in the ACC said the anti-corruption watchdog has formed several probe teams to find and check institutional corruption. The teams are working on different sectors.

In the letter, information was sought about different road, bridge, culvert construction and repair projects implemented in different upazilas and unions in the last three years.
