Basic Bank’s Gulshan branch to be shut
Finance Minister AMA Muhith on Thursday said the operation of Basic Bank’s Gulshan branch would be stopped because of corruption.

“I must stop the operation of the Basic Bank’s Gulshan branch which got involved in massive corruption. The whole bank’s corruption has been a subject of shame for the government,” the minister said while receiving dividend of one million pound starling from the officials of the Sonali Bank UK Limited at the finance ministry.

Terming the dividend from Sonali Bank UK as good news for the government, Muhith said this is really a good achievement while the corruption has gripped the state-owned banks.

A delegation of the Sonali Bank UK, led by its CEO Ataur Rahman Prodhan, handed over the dividend to the Finance Minister. Banking Division’s secretary and Sonali Bank UK’s chairman Aslamul Alam was also present on the occasion.
