Ansar member shot dead in Moghbazar
Miscreants shot dead an Ansar member in T&T Colony area of Moghbazar in Dhaka on early Thursday.



The victim was Abdul Halim, 28, son of Mirza Fakir of Shaghata upazila in Gaibandha.



Ramna police sub-inspector Hafiz said Abdul Halim was posted at T&T Colony IPS factory. He was on duty along with two others at about 1:15am in front of the colony gate.



All of a sudden, a group of miscreants, numbering 5-6, wearing helmets and riding two rickshaws tried to enter the colony.



As the Ansar members intercepted them, there took place an altercation between them.

At one stage, the miscreants fired gunshots targeting them and Halim received multiple bullet injuries, said SI Hafiz.

Abdul Halim was rushed to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) where he was pronounced dead. Later, the body was sent to the DMCH morgue.

Ramna police officer-in-charge Mashiur Rahman said, the miscreants did not come to kill Alim. The police alleged that the miscreants came to kill Ahad, one of the owners of the factory. Few days back, Ahad quarrelled with Ramiz Uddin, the other owner of the factory. Police held Ramiz for interrogation in this connection.
