Zia, Ershad rehabilitated war criminals: Ashraf
Ruling Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam on Tuesday alleged that BNP founder Ziaur Rahman and former military ruler HM Ersahd rehabilitated war criminals in the country after 1975, reports UNB news agency.

“We defeated Pakistan in the 1971 liberation war, but Ziaur Rahman and Ersahd rehabilitated the war criminals after the assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to avenge the war defeat,” he said.

Ashraf, also the public administration minister, came up with the remarks at a discussion at Shahbagh in the city marking the ‘Freedom Fighters’ Day’.

Observing that the liberation war is the core spirit, and Bangabandhu is the supreme leader of Bangladesh, he said those who want to exclude Bangabandhu and the liberation war from the country will get removed from history.

Syed Ashraf also assured the freedom fighters of discussing with prime minister Sheikh Hasina about officially declaring 1 December as ‘Freedom Fighters’ Day’ as now being observed only by the freedom fighters.

He urged all the freedom fighters to get united under the leadership of Hasina.

Among others, liberation war affairs minister AKM Mozammel Haque and shipping minister Shajahan Khan spoke on the occasion.
