‘Mastermind’ behind SP’s wife murder held, claim police
The police claimed on Saturday that they have arrested a youth in connection with the murder of Chittagong police superintendent Babul Akhter’s wife Mahmuda Khanam.



Police said the arrestee, Sahjahan alias Robin, might have masterminded the killing.



The youth was arrested on Saturday morning from the Shital Jharna area of Bayazid Bastami in the port city, said Chittagong Metropolitan Police (CMP) commissioner Md Iqbal Bahar.



“During the interrogation, the youth confessed to speaking over a mobile phone right next to the crime scene when the murder took place,” said the CMP commissioner.



The police officer, however, did not explain whether the youth’s confession to speaking over phone necessarily indicates that he was involved in the killing.



The wife of police SP, Mahmuda Khanam, was hacked and then shot to death by three bikers near GEC crossing in Chittagong when she was going to drop her son for the school bus on 6 June morning.



Later on the day, police super Babul Akhter filed a murder case in this connection accusing three unnamed people.



Police said the murder was an act of revenge against SP Babul Akhter who had a prominent role in curbing militants.
