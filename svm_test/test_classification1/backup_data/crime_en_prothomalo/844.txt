Land official caught taking bribe
The Anti-Corruption Commission on Tuesday caught a land official in Chittagong city red-handed while taking bribe.

A seven-member ACC team, led by its deputy director Mosharraf Hossain Mrida, arrested office assistant of Assistant Commissioner’s (Land) office (Agrabad circle) Sanjib Kumar Dey from his office in the port city.

ACC public relations officer Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya confirmed this to news agency UNB.

Haji Mohammad Safi of Agrabad recently went to the local land office for the mutation of a land, but Sanjib Kumar had long been harassing him demanding Tk 20, 000 for his job. Later, he agreed to do so at Tk 10,000.

The victim then submitted a written complaint against the office assistant with the commission.

In consultation with the ACC officials, the plaintiff went to the land office again on Tuesday afternoon to give Sanjib Kumar Tk 10,000 as bribe. While receiving the money, the ACC team caught him red-handed.
