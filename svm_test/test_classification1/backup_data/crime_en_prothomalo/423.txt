BELA director Rizwana’s husband abducted
Bangladesh Environment Lawyers’ Association (BELA) executive director Syeda Rizwana Hasan’s husband has reportedly been abducted in Narayanganj.



Abu Bakar Siddique, an executive director of a garment factory, was on his way to Dhaka when he was abducted on Wednesday.



Quoting Ripon, driver of Abu Bakar’s car, Rizwana told reporters that a Blue microbus pushed the car from behind at about 2:30pm in front of Bhuiyan Filling Station of Fatullah on the Dhaka-Narayanganj Link Road.



Abu Bakar stopped his car on the road and got off from the vehicle. The abductors, however, came and picked him up brandishing weapons and drove away.



Fatullah model police officer-in-charge Akhter Hossain said, they had already send messages to police outposts on Dhaka-Sylhet and Dhaka-Chittagong routes to stay alert. He, however, could not mention any reason behind the abduction.

Driver Ripan said the Microbus was a blue coloured Noah and a total of seven to eight armed persons were on board. The abductors had short hair and T-shirts.

Rizwana at the office of the Narayanganj superintendent of police told reporters that his husband has no personal rivalry with anybody.

She said they do not have such valuable propriety for which anyone can kidnap him to get ransom. She also said that her husband could be abducted because of professional rivalry.
