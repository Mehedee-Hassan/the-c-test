BCL men assault official, trade halted at Benapole
Export and import activities through Benapole Land Port came to a halt on Wednesday following an assault on a joint commissioner of the port’s customs house allegedly by Bangladesh Chattra League men.

Inspector of Benapole Customs Rafiqul Islam said some local Chhatra League leaders wanted to purchase to have some goods put on auction by the customs authorities with lower prices.

The BCL leaders purportedly turned angry as joint commissioner of the customs house Mustafizur Rahman turned down their proposal.

“A group of 10-12 people met the joint commissioner around noon at his office and locked into an altercation with him. They assaulted Mustafizur Rahman as he had rejected their proposal. Deputy commissioner Nitish Chandra was also assaulted when he tried to save the joint commissioner,” he added.

Protesting the incident, the officials and employees of the customs house put their activities on hold.

Holding Chattra League men responsible for the attack, the officials and employees wore black badge and staged demonstrations there in protest against the incident.

Officer-in-charge of Benapole Port Thana Apurba Hasan said the situation is now under control as the police have been deployed there.

A case was lodged with the Port Thana after identifying the offenders after scrutinising a video footage.
