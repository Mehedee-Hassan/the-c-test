Full text of Sayedee’s verdict released
The Supreme Court on Thursday released the full text of its verdict commuting Jamaat-e-Islami leader Delwar Hossain Sayedee’s death penalty to jail unto death in the case for his crimes against humanity during the Liberation War in 1971, reports news agency UNB.

The written verdict was released on website of the apex court after the five judges-former Chief Justice Md Muzammel Hossain, Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha, Justice Md Abdul Wahhab Miah, Justice Hasan Foez Siddique and Justice AHM Shamsuddin Choudhury of the Appellate Division bench signed the copies of the verdict reducing the death sentence for committing crimes against humanity during the Liberation War.

On 17 September, 2014, the Appellate Division of the SC commuted the death penalty of Sayedee to imprisonment until death for the wartime crimes.

Earlier on 28 February, 2013, the International Crimes Tribunal-1 sentenced Sayedee to death for war crimes.

On 28 March, 2013, Sayedee filed an appeal with the apex court seeking acquittal from the charges and the government side on the same day submitted a separate appeal to the SC demanding capital punishment in all the eight charges.

Sayedee was involved in the incidents like killing, looting, rape and converting Hindus into Muslims in Parerhat of Pirojpur district.
