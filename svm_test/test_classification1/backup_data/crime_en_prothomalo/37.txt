'Khaleda bears marks of corruption'
Information minister Hasanul Haq Inu on Thursday said BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia is not a medieval queen that she would be spared after her corruptions and burning people to death.

Accusing her for killing, corruption and embezzlement of orphans' funds, Inu said, "She (Khaleda) has got blood in her hands and bears marks of corruption."

The minister came up with the remarks while addressing a discussion as chief guest at Mukti Bhaban in capital's Puranapaltan marking the May Day.

The people, who will lobby for releasing Khaleda in arson case, are enemies of democracy, Inu said.

"The democracy of the country will be troubled if Khaleda is allowed to do politics in Bangladesh. It would be better if she (Khaleda) is wiped out from politics for the sake of country's politics and democracy," he said.

"She should have bid politics adieu by this time if she thinks she has a mere sense of self-esteem," Inu added.
