Polling agents being intimidated: BNP
The BNP on Monday alleged that the agents of the party-backed candidates in city polls were being intimidated in different parts of Dhaka city.

The BNP's secretary for international affairs Asaduzzaman Ripon made the complaints while briefing newsmen at the party's Nayapaltan central office in the afternoon.

The BNP leader asked the election commission to take strong stand to deal with such issues or else to resign.

"The EC is not deploying the army since the government did not give a green signal for that," he said.

Asaduzzaman made a final call upon the EC to take effective initiative to ensure free and fair elections.

The BNP leader accused the Awami League men and the joint forces of harrasing the BNP leaders and activists during the election campaigns.

"Also, there is a fraud organisation named 'Mousus' which has been authorised to monitor the elections as observers," he said adding that the BNP would not accept any report of that kind of organisation.

Asaduzzaman outright rejected the claims of distribution of money by the BNP supported candidates, saying, "The BNP does not do politics of money," he said.
