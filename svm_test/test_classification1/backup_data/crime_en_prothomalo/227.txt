JCD general secretary on remand
A Dhaka Court on Sunday remanded Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal general Secretary Habibur Rashid on police custody for three days on vandalism and arson charges.

Dhaka chief judicial magistrate gave the order after police presented Habibur Rashid before the court on Saturday.

Dhaka airport immigration police captured Habibur on early Saturday while he was on his way to the United States to meet his family staying there.

Immigration police handed him over to the airport police. He was later taken to the Detective Branch office on Minto Road in Dhaka.

Later, Habibur was shown arrested in a case filed on September 22 with the Shahbagh police against many unnamed persons for vandalising and setting fire to vehicles during a hartal imposed by 20-Party Alliance activists.

Dhaka Metropolitan Police media and public relations deputy commissioner Masudur Rahman confirmed the charges slapped on Habibur.

Protesting at the arrest of its general secretary, JCD on Saturday announced protests in districts, metropolitan cities and universities on Sunday and in upazilas, colleges and municipalities on Monday.

Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting general secretary Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir in a statement has condemned the arrest of Habibur Rashid and demanded his immediate release.
