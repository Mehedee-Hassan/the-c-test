A Jessore court has awarded three-year rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Tk 10,000 to five Indian nationals for smuggling gold.



The court also ordered to deposit the 4.5 kilogram gold seized from the accused, to the national exchequer.



Additional district and sessions judge of Jessore, Almas Hossain Mridha, delivered the verdict on Sunday afternoon.



The convicted are Bijay Kumar of Nagpur city’s Shanti Naicosi area in India, Kamal of Nagpur Zirapatka Hudko Colony, Ram Kumar Golabmaal of Neat Quarter area, Rohit Ashok of Kachikali Aloka’s Sindi Camp, and Rakesh Laxman of Ahmadabad’s Vinnak Park in India.



Public prosecutor Rafiqul Islam said the five Indian nationals confessed about their involvement in the gold smuggling. Currently, they are imprisoned in Jessore central jail.



On 22 June 2014, Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB)’s 26 battalion members arrested the five convicted from a bus on Jessore-Benapole road.

The BGB members recovered 36 gold bars worth approximately Tk 2,20,00,000 from their possession.
