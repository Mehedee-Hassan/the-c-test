Housewife killed over dowry
A housewife was strangulated to death allegedly by her husband and in-laws over a dowry-related dispute at

Dakkhin Majupur in Laxmipur municipality area on Monday night.

The deceased was identified as Sharmin Akter Rimi, wife of Delwar Hossain, reports news agency UNB.

The victim’s father filed a case with Laxmipur Sadar Police Station against five people, including Delwar Hossain, in connection with the incident.

Police and victim’s family sources said Rimi, daughter of Siddique Ullah of Charmandal village, had a relationship of love with Delwar Hossain, son of Nur Nabi of Dakkhin Majupur. They got married three months back.

However, family members of Delwar did not accept Rimi as his wife.

After a few days, Delwar and his family members demanded dowry from Rimi’s family.

Delwar and his family members tortured the Rimi regularly as she refused to bring dowry money from her parents.

On Monday night, the couple locked in an altercation over the issue.

At one stage, they beat up Rimi mercilessly and strangled her and spread a rumour in the area that Rimi committed suicide.

On information, police recovered the body on Monday night and sent it to Laxmipur Sadar Hospital for an autopsy, said Officer-in-Charge of Laxmipur Sadar Police Station Abdullah-Al-Mamun Bhuiyan.
