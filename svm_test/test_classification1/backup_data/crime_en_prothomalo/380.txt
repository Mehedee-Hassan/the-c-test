BD to talk with Myanmar over drug smuggling
Bangladesh seeks to hold talks with Myanmar to discuss ways to prevent drug smuggling along the border, home ministry officials said on Saturday.

Home ministry additional secretary Kamal Uddin Ahmed said that the foreign ministry has been asked to contact Myanmar to set a date for the talks.

Bangladesh has long been worried about a huge inflow of smuggled contraband drugs like Yaba and Phensedyl from Myanmar.

A home ministry delegation, headed by home minister Asaduzzaman Khan, has been on a visit to Bangladesh's border areas with Myanmar since Friday to inspect measures to stop the drug trafficking.

Asaduzzaman said Bangladesh looks forward to a fruitful dialogue with the Myanmar authorities and find a solution to the long-standing issue.
